    "content": "5 \n \n \n2017, which represents a comfortable cover for about 12 months of \nimports.  \n8.  The Government has also continued on the steady path of fiscal \nconsolidation, without compromising on the public investment \nrequirements of the economy. Externally, the economy successfully \nweathered a number of shocks, the redemption of FCNR deposits, volatility \nfrom the US elections and the Fed rate hike.   According to IMF forecast, \nIndia is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in 2017.  \n  \n9. A number of global reports and assessments, over the last two \nyears, have shown that India has considerably improved its policies, \npractices and economic profile.  These are reflected in Doing Business \nReport of the World Bank; World Investment Report 2016 of UNCTAD; \nGlobal Competitiveness Report of 2015-16 and 2016-17 of the World \nEconomic Forum; and several other Reports.  India has become the sixth \nlargest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth previously.  We \nare seen as an engine of global growth. \n \n10. In the last one year, our country has witnessed historic and \nimpactful economic reforms and policy making.  In fact, India was one of the \nvery few economies undertaking transformational reforms. There were two \ntectonic policy initiatives, namely, passage of the Constitution Amendment \nBill for GST and the progress for its implementation ; and demonetisation of \nhigh denomination bank notes.  The advantages of GST for our economy in \nterms of spurring growth, competitiveness, indirect tax simplification and \ngreater transparency have already been extensively discussed in both \nHouses of Parliament.  I thank all Members of both the Houses for having \npassed the Constitution Amendment unanimously.   I also thank the State \nGovernments for resolving all relevant issues in the GST Council.    \n \n11. Demonetisation of high denomination bank notes was in \ncontinuation of a series of measures taken by our Government during the \nlast two years.  It is a bold and decisive measure.  For several decades, tax \nevasion for many has become a way of life.  This compromises the larger \npublic interest and creates unjust enrichment in favour of the tax evader, to \nthe detriment of the poor and deprived.   This has bred a parallel economy \nwhich is unacceptable for an inclusive society.  Demonetisation seeks to \ncreate a new \u2018normal\u2019 w herein the GDP would be bigger, cleaner and real. \nThis exercise is part of our Government\u2019s resolve to eliminate corruption, \nblack money, counterfeit currency and terror funding.   Like all reforms, this \nmeasure is obviously disruptive, as it seeks to change the retrograde status \nquo.  Drop in economic activity, if any, on account of the currency squeeze \nduring the remonetisation period is expected to have only a transient 6 \n \n \nimpact on the economy.  I am reminded here of what the Father of the \nNation, Mahatma Gandhi, had said: \u201cA right cause never fails\u201d.  \n12. Demonetisation has strong potential to generate long-term benefits \nin terms of reduced corruption, greater digitisation of the economy, \nincreased flow of financial savings and greater formalisation of the \neconomy, all of which would eventually lead to higher GDP growth and tax \nrevenues. Demonetisation helps to transfer resources from the tax evaders \nto the Government, which can use these resources for the welfare of the \npoor and the deprived.  There is early evidence of an increased capacity of \nBanks to lend at reduced interest rates and a huge shift towards digitisation \namong all sections of society. We firmly believe that demonetisation and \nGST which were built on the third transformational achievement of our \nGovernment, namely, the JAM vision, will have an epoch making impact on \nour economy and the lives of our people.   \n \n13. Madam Speaker, we are at an important turning point in the path of \nour growth and development.   \n \n \n<\u00ba\u00c9 \u00e0\u00c9\u00c9\u00e4\u00bd {\u00c9\u00ae P\u00c9\u00a4\u00c9\u00ae\u00c9 B\u00c9\u00e4E x\u00c9 l\u00c9\u00e0\u00c9 V\u00c9\u00c9<A +\u00c9\u00c9{\u00c9 \nV\u00c9\u00c9\u00e4 \u00a4\u00c9\u00c9i\u00c9 x\u00c9\u00aa\u00c9\u00c9\u00d2 c\u00e8 =\u00ba\u00c9\u00e4 +\u00c9{\u00c9x\u00c9\u00c9<A +\u00c9\u00c9{\u00c9 \nb\u00aei\u00c9\u00e4 c\u00e9 x\u00c9\u00aa\u00c9\u00c9\u00d2 \u00ae\u00c9c {\u00c9\u00e4 B\u00c9D\u00aa\u00c9\u00c9\u00e5 S\u00c9\u00e3\u00c9x\u00c9\u00e4 \u00ba\u00c9\u00e4  \nc\u00e0\u00c9 +\u00c9\u00c9M\u00c9\u00e4-+\u00c9\u00c9M\u00c9\u00e4 S\u00c9\u00e3\u00c9i\u00c9\u00e4 c\u00e9 +\u00c9\u00c9V\u00c9\u00c9<A +\u00c9\u00c9{\u00c9  \n \n14. The pace of remonetisation has picked up and will soon reach \ncomfortable levels.  The effects of demonetisation are not expected to spill \nover into the next year.  Thus IMF, even while revising India\u2019s GDP forecast \nfor 2016 downwards, has projected a GDP growth of 7.2% and 7.7% in 2017 \nand 2018 respectively. The World Bank, however, is more optimistic and \nhas projected a GDP growth of 7% in 2016-17, 7.6% in 2017-18 and 7.8% in \n2018-19. This pick up in our economy is premised upon our policy and \ndetermination to continue with economic reforms; increase in public \ninvestment in infrastructure and development projects; and export growth \nin the context of the expected rebound in world economy.  The surplus \nliquidity in the banking system, created by demonetisation, will lower \nborrowing costs and increase the access to credit.  This will boost economic \nactivity, with multiplier effects.  \n \n15. The announcements made by Honourable Prime Minister on 31 st \nDecember, 2016 address many of the key concerns of our economy at this \njuncture, such as, housing for the poor; relief to farmers; credit support to 7 \n \n \nMSMEs; encouragement to digital transactions; assistance to pregnant \nwomen and senior citizens; and priority to dalits, tribals, backward classes \nand women under the Mudra Yojana.   \n \n16. My overall approach, while preparing this Budget, has been to spend \nmore in rural areas, infrastructure and poverty alleviation and yet maintain \nthe best standards of fiscal prudence.  I have also kept in mind the need to \ncontinue with economic reforms, promote higher investments and \naccelerate growth.   \n17. The last one year was a witness to other major reforms, namely, \nenactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code; amendment to the RBI \nAct for inflation targeting; enactment of the Aadhar bill for disbursement of \nfinancial subsidies and benefits; significant reforms in FDI policy; the job \ncreating package for textile sector; and several other measures.  We will \ncontinue the process of economic reforms for the benefit of the poor and \nthe underprivileged.   \n18. Madam Speaker , the Budget for 2017-18 contains three major \nreforms.  First, the presentation of the Budget has been advanced to 1 st \nFebruary to enable the Parliament to avoid a Vote on Account and pass a \nsingle Appropriation Bill for 2017-18, before the close of the current \nfinancial year.  This would enable the Ministries and Departments to \noperationalise all schemes and projects, including the new schemes, right \nfrom the commencement of the next financial year.  They would be able to \nfully utilise the available working season before the onset of the monsoon.  \nSecond, the merger of the Railways Budget with the General Budget is a \nhistoric step.  We have discontinued the colonial practice prevalent since \n1924. This decision brings the Railways to the centre stage of Government\u2019s \nfiscal policy and would facilitate multi modal transport planning between \nrailways, highways and inland waterways. The functional autonomy of \nRailways will, however, continue. Third, we have done away with the plan \nand non-plan classification of expenditure.  This will give us a holistic view \nof allocations for sectors and ministries. This would facilitate optimal \nallocation of resources.  \n \n19. Madam Speaker , we are aware that we need to do more for our \npeople. Continuing with the task of fulfilling the people\u2019s expectations, our \nagenda for the next year is : \u201cTransform, Energise and Clean India\u201d, that is, \nTEC India.  This agenda of TEC India seeks to  \n \n\uf0b7 Transform the quality of governance and quality of life  of our \npeople;  8 \n \n \n\uf0b7 Energise various sections of society, especially the youth and \nthe vulnerable, and enable them to unleash their true \npotential; and \n\uf0b7 Clean the country from the evils of corruption, black money \nand non-transparent political funding.   \nI propose to present my Budget proposals under ten distinct themes to \nfoster this broad agenda.  The themes are :   \n(i) Farmers : for whom we have committed to double the income \nin 5 years; \n(ii) Rural Population : providing employment and basic \ninfrastructure;  \n(iii) Youth : energising them through education, skills and jobs; \n(iv) Poor and the Underprivileged  : strengthening the systems of \nsocial security, health care and affordable housing;  \n(v) Infrastructure:  for efficiency, productivity and quality of life; \n(vi) Financial Sector : growth and stability through stronger \ninstitutions;  \n(vii) Digital Economy\n :  for speed, accountability and transparency; \n(viii) Public Service  : effective governance and efficient service \ndelivery through people\u2019s participation; \n(ix) Prudent Fiscal Management  : to ensure optimal deployment \nof resources and preserve fiscal stability; and \n(x) Tax Administration : honouring the honest.  \n \nI. FARMERS \n20. The Indian farmer has once again shown his commitment and \nresilience in the current year.  The total area sown under kharif and rabi \nseasons are higher  than the previous year.  With a better monsoon, \nagriculture is expected to grow at 4.1% in the current year.   \n \n21. In last year\u2019s Budget speech, I focused on \u2018income security\u2019 of \nfarmers to double their income in 5 years.  I had also announced a number \nof measures. We have to take more steps and enable the farmers to \nincrease their production and productivity; and to deal with post-harvest \nchallenges.  \n 9 \n \n \n22. For a good crop, adequate credit should be available to farmers in \ntime.  The target for agricultural credit in 2017-18 has been fixed at a record \nlevel of ` 10 lakh crores.  We will take special efforts to ensure adequate \nflow of credit to the under serviced areas, the Eastern States and Jammu & \nKashmir.  The farmers will also benefit from 60 days\u2019 interest waiver \nannounced by Honourable Prime Minister in respect of their loans from the \ncooperative credit structure. \n \n23. About 40% of the small and marginal farmers avail credit from the \ncooperative structure.  The Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) act \nas the front end for loan disbursements. We will support NABARD for \ncomputerisation and integration of all 63,000 functional PACS with the Core \nBanking System of District Central Cooperative Banks.  This will be done in 3 \nyears at an estimated cost of ` 1,900 crores, with financial participation \nfrom State Governments. This will ensure seamless flow of credit to small \nand marginal farmers.   \n \n24. At the time of sowing, farmers should feel secure against natural \ncalamities.  The Fasal Bima Yojana launched by our Government is a major \nstep in this direction.  The coverage of this scheme will be increased from \n30% of cropped area in 2016-17 to 40% in 2017-18 and 50% in 2018-19.  \nThe Budget provision of ` 5,500 crores for this Yojana in BE 2016-17 was \nincreased to ` 13,240 crores in RE 2016-17 to settle the arrear claims.  For \n2017-18, I have provided a sum of ` 9,000 crores. The sum insured under \nthis Yojana has more than doubled from ` 69,000 crores in Kharif 2015 to \n`\n 1,41,625 crores in Kharif 2016. \n25. Issuance of Soil Health Cards has gathered momentum.  The real \nbenefit to farmers would be available only when the soil samples are tested \nquickly and nutrient level of the soil is known.  Government will therefore \nset up new mini labs in Krishi Vigyan Kendras  (KVKs) and ensure 100% \ncoverage of all 648 KVKs in the country.   In addition, 1000 mini labs will be \nset up by qualified local entrepreneurs.  Government will provide credit \nlinked subsidy to these entrepreneurs.  \n \n26. A Long Term Irrigation Fund has already been set up in NABARD.  \nHonourable Prime Minister has announced an addition of `\n 20,000 crores to \nits corpus.  This will take the total corpus of this Fund to ` 40,000 crores. \n \n27. A dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund will be set up in NABARD to \nachieve the goal, \u2018per drop more crop\u2019. The Fund wil l have an initial corpus \nof `5,000 crores. \n 10 \n \n \n28. For the post-harvest phase, we will take steps to enable farmers to \nget better prices for their produce in the markets.  The coverage of National \nAgricultural Market (e-NAM) will be expanded from the current 250 \nmarkets to 585 APMCs.  Assistance up to a ceiling of ` 75 lakhs will be \nprovided to every e-NAM market for establishment of cleaning, grading and \npackaging facilities.  This will lead to value addition of farmers\u2019 produce. \n \n29. Market reforms will be undertaken and the States would be urged to \ndenotify perishables from APMC.  This will give opportunity to farmers to \nsell their produce and get better prices. \n30. We also propose to integrate farmers who grow fruits and \nvegetables with agro processing units for better price realisation and \nreduction of post-harvest losses.  A model law on contract farming would \ntherefore be prepared and circulated among the States for adoption.   \n \n31. Dairy is an important source of additional income for the farmers.  \nAvailability of milk processing facility and other infrastructure will benefit \nthe farmers through value addition.  A large number of milk processing \nunits set up under the Operation Flood Programme has since become old \nand obsolete. A Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund \nwould be set up in NABARD with a corpus of ` 8,000 crores over 3 years.  \nInitially, the Fund will start with a corpus of ` 2,\n000 crores.   \n \nII. RURAL POPULATION  \n \n32. I now turn to the Rural Sector, which was so dear to the heart of \nMahatma Gandhi.  \n33. Over ` 3 lakh crores are spent in rural areas every year, if we add up \nall the programmes meant for rural poor from the Central Budget, State \nBudgets, Bank linkage for self-help groups, etc. With a clear focus on \nimproving accountability, outcomes and convergence, we will undertake a \nMission Antyodaya to bring one crore households out of poverty and to \nmake 50,000 gram panchayats poverty free by 2019, the 150th birth \nanniversary of Gandhiji.  We will utilise the existing resources more \neffectively along with annual increases.  This mission will work with a \nfocused micro plan for sustainable livelihood for every deprived household.  \nA composite index for poverty free gram panchayats would be developed to \nmonitor the progress from the baseline.  \n 11 \n \n \n34. Our Government has made a conscious effort to reorient MGNREGA \nto support our resolve to double farmers\u2019 income. While providing at least \n100 days employment to every rural household,  MGNREGA should create \nproductive assets to improve farm productivity and incomes.  The target of \n5 lakh farm ponds and 10 lakh compost pits announced in the last Budget \nfrom MGNREGA funds will be fully achieved.  In fact, against 5 lakh farm \nponds, it is expected that about 10 lakh farm ponds would be completed by \nMarch 2017.  During 2017-18, another 5 lakh farm ponds will be taken up.  \nThis single measure will contribute greatly to drought proofing of gram \npanchayats.  \n \n35.  Participation of women in MGNREGA has increased to 55% from \nless than 48% in the past. \n36. Honourable Members would be happy to note that the budget \nprovision of `\n38,500 crores under MGNREGA in 2016-17 has been increased \nto `48,000 crores in 2017-18.  This is the highest ever allocation for \nMGNREGA.  The initiative to g eo-tag all MGNREGA assets and putting them \nin public domain has established greater transparency.  We are also using \nspace technology in a big way to plan MGNREGA works.   \n \n37. The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is now being \nimplemented as never before.  The pace of construction of PMGSY roads \nhas accelerated to reach 133 km roads per day in 2016-17, as against an \naverage of 73 km during the period 2011-2014.  We have also taken up the \ntask of connecting habitations with more than 100 persons in left wing \nextremism affected Blocks.  We have committed to complete the current \ntarget under PMGSY by 2019.  I have provided a sum of ` 19,000 crores in \n2017-18 for this scheme.  Together with the contribution of States, an \namount of ` 27,000 crores will be spent on PMGSY in 2017-18. \n \n38. We propose to complete 1 crore houses by 2019 for the  \nhouseless and those living in kutcha houses.  I have stepped up the \nallocation for Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana \u2013 Gramin from ` 15,000 crores \nin BE 2016-17 to ` 23,000 crores in 2017-18.   \n \n39. We are well on our way to achieving 100% village electrification by \n1st May 2018.  An increased allocation of ` 4,814 crores has been proposed \nunder the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana in 2017-18.  \n \n40. I have also proposed to increase the allocations for Deendayal  \nAntyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission for promotion of skill \ndevelopment and livelihood opportunities for people in rural areas  to 12 \n \n \n`4,500 in 2017-18.  The allocation for Prime Minister's Employment \nGeneration Programme ( PMEGP) and credit support schemes has been \nincreased more than 3 times. \n \n41. Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) has made tremendous progress in \npromoting safe sanitation and ending open defecation.  Sanitation coverage \nin rural India has gone up from 42% in October 2014 to about 60%.  Open \nDefecation Free villages are now being given priority for piped water supply.   \n42. We propose to provide safe drinking water to over 28,000 arsenic \nand fluoride affected habitations in the next four years.  This will be a sub \nmission of the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP).    \n43. For imparting new skills to the people in the rural areas, mason \ntraining will be provided to 5 lakh persons by 2022, with an immediate \ntarget of training at least 20,000 persons by 2017-18.  \n44. Panchayati raj institutions still lack human resources for \nimplementing deve lopment programmes.  A programme of \u201chuman \nresource reforms for results\u201d will be launched during 2017 -18 for this \npurpose.  \n45. The Government will continue to work closely with the farmers and \nthe people in the rural areas to improve their life and environment.  This is a \nnon-negotiable agenda for our Government.  The total allocation for the \nrural, agriculture and allied sectors in 2017-18 is `\n 1,87,223 crores, which is \n24% higher than the previous year. \nIII. YOUTH   \n46. Let me now focus on my proposals for the youth. \n47. Quality education will energise our youth. In the words of Swami \nVivekananda, \u201cThe education which does not help the common mass of \npeople to equip themselves for the struggle for life \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 is it worth the \nname?\u201d \n48. We have proposed to introduce a system of measuring annual \nlearning outcomes in our schools.  Emphasis will be given on science \neducation and flexibility in curriculum to promote creativity through local \ninnovative content.   13 \n \n \n49. An Innovation Fund for Secondary Education will be created to \nencourage local innovation for ensuring universal access, gender parity and \nquality improvement. This will include ICT enabled learning transformation.  \nThe focus will be on 3479 educationally backward blocks. \n50. In higher education, we will undertake reforms in the UGC.  Good \nquality institutions would be enabled to have greater administrative and \nacademic autonomy.  Colleges will be identified based on accredi tation and \nranking, and given autonomous status. A revised framework will be put in \nplace for outcome based accreditation and credit based programmes. \n \n51. We propose to leverage information technology and launch \nSWAYAM platform with at least 350 online courses.  This would enable \nstudents to virtually attend the courses taught by the best faculty; access \nhigh quality reading resources; participate in discussion forums; take tests \nand earn academic grades.  Access to SWAYAM would be widened by \nlinkage with DTH channels, dedicated to education.   \n \n52. We propose to establish a National Testing Agency as an \nautonomous and self-sustained premier testing organisation to conduct all \nentrance examinations for higher education institutions.   This would free \nCBSE, AICTE and other premier institutions from these administrative \nresponsibilities so that they can focus more on academics.   \n \n53. We have a huge demographic advantage.  Skill India mission was \nlaunched in July 2015 to maximise the potential of our youth.   \n \n54. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras  (PMKK) have already been \npromoted in more than 60 districts.  We now propose to extend these \nKendras to more than 600 districts across the country.  100 India \nInternational Skills Centres will be established across the country.   These \nCentres would offer advanced training and also courses in foreign \nlanguages.  This will help those of our youth who seek job opportunities \noutside the country. \n \n55. In 2017-18, we also propose to launch the Skill Acquisition and \nKnowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion programme (SANKALP) at a \ncost of `\n 4,000 crores.  SANKALP will provide market relevant training to 3.5 \ncrore youth. 14 \n \n \n \n56. The next phase of Skill Strengthening for Industrial Value \nEnhancement (STRIVE) will also be launched in 2017-18 at a cost of ` 2,200 \ncrores.  STRIVE will focus on improving the quality and market relevance of \nvocational training provided in ITIs and strengthen the apprenticeship \nprogrammes through industry cluster approach. \n \n57. A special scheme for creating employment in the textile sector has \nalready been launched.  A similar scheme will be implemented for the \nleather and footwear industries. \n \n58. Tourism is a big employment generator and has a multiplier impact \non the economy. Five Special Tourism Zones, anchored on SPVs, will be set \nup in partnership with the States. Incredible India 2.0 Campaign will be \nlaunched across the world.   \nIV.  THE POOR AND THE UNDERPRIVILEGED \n59. Madam Speaker, I now turn to my proposals for the poor and the \nunderprivileged.  \n \n60. Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas begins with the girl child and women.  \nMahila Shakti Kendra will be set up at village level with an allocation of \n`\n 500 crores in 14 lakh ICDS Anganwadi Centres.  This will provide one stop \nconvergent support services for empowering rural women with \nopportunities for skill development, employment, digital literacy, health \nand nutrition.  A nationwide scheme for financial assistance to pregnant \nwomen has already been announced by  Honourable Prime Minister on 31st \nDecember, 2016.  Under this scheme, ` 6,000 each will be transferred \ndirectly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional \ndelivery and vaccinate their children. \n \n61. For the welfare of Women and Children under various schemes \nacross all Ministries, I have stepped up the allocation from ` 1,56,528 crores \nin BE 2016-17 to ` 1,84,632 crores in 2017-18. \n \n62.   We propose to facilitate higher investment in affordable housing. \nAff\nordable housing will now be given infrastructure status, which will \nenable these projects to avail the associated benefits.  \n 15 \n \n \n63. The National Housing Bank will refinance individual housing loans of \nabout ` 20,000 crore in 2017-18.  Thanks to the surplus liquidity created by \ndemonetisation, the Banks have already started reducing their lending \nrates, including those for housing.  In addition, interest subvention for \nhousing loans has also been announced by the Honourable Prime Minister. \n64. Poverty is usually associated with poor health.  It is the poor who \nsuffer the maximum from various chronic diseases.  Government has \ntherefore prepared an action plan to eliminate Kala-Azar and Filariasis by \n2017, Leprosy by 2018 and Measles by 2020.  Elimination of tuberculosis by \n2025 is also targeted.  Similarly,   action plan has been prepared to reduce \nIMR from 39 in 2014 to 28 by 2019 and MMR from 167 in 2011-13 to   100 \nby 2018-2020.  1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres will be transformed into Health \nand Wellness Centres. \n65. We need to ensure adequate availability of specialist doctors to \nstrengthen Secondary and Tertiary levels of health care.  We have therefore \ndecided to take steps to create additional 5,000 Post Graduate seats per \nannum.   In addition, steps will be taken to roll out DNB courses in big \nDistrict Hospitals; strengthen PG teaching in select ESI and Municipal \nCorporation Hospitals; and encourage reputed Private Hospitals to start \nDNB courses. We will work with the State Governments to take these tasks \nforward.  The Government is committed to take necessary steps for \nstructural transformation of the Regulatory framework of Medical \nEducation and Practice in India. \n \n66. Two new All India Institutes of Medical Sciences will be set up in the \nStates of Jharkhand and Gujarat. \n \n67. We propose to amend the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules to ensure \navailability of drugs at reasonable prices and promote use of generic \nmedicines. New rules for regulating medical devices will also be formulated.  \nThese rules will be internationally harmonised and attract investment into \nthis sector.  This will reduce the cost of such devices.  \n \n68. We are keen on fostering a conducive labour environment wherein \nlabour rights are protected and harmonious labour relations lead to higher \nproductivity.     Legislative reforms will be undertaken to simplify, rationalise \nand amalgamate the existing labour laws into 4 Codes on (i) wages; (ii) \nindustrial relations; (iii) social security and welfare; and (iv) safety and \nworking conditions.  The Model Shops and Establishment Bill 2016 has been \ncirculated to all States for consideration and adoption.  This would open up \nadditional avenues for employment of women. The amendment made to 16 \n \n \nthe Payment of Wages Act,  is another initiative of our Government for the \nbenefit of the labour and ease of doing business.   \n \n69. Our Government is giving special importance to implementation of \nthe schemes for welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and \nMinorities.  The allocation for the welfare of Scheduled Castes has been \nstepped up from `38,833 crores in BE 2016-17 to `\n 52,393 crores in \n2017-18, representing an increase of about 35%. The allocation for \nScheduled Tribes has been increased to `31,920 crores and for Minorit y \nAffairs to `4,195 crores. The Government will introduce outcome based \nmonitoring of expenditure in these sectors by the NITI Aayog.   \n \n70. For senior citizens, Aadhar based Smart Cards containing their \nhealth details will be introduced.  A beginning will be made through a pilot \nin 15 districts during 2017-18.  The LIC will implement a scheme for senior \ncitizens to provide assured pension, with a guaranteed return of 8% per \nannum for 10 years.  \nV. INFRASTRUCTURE \n71. The fifth component of TEC India agenda is Infrastructure.   \n \n72. Railways, roads and rivers are the lifeline of our country.  I feel \nprivileged to present the first combined Budget of independent India that \nincludes the Railways also.  We are now in a position to synergise the \ninvestments in railways, roads, waterways and civil aviation. For 2017-18, \nthe total capital and development expenditure of Railways has been pegged \nat ` 1,31,000 crores.  This includes `\n 55,000 crores provided by the \nGovernment.    \n \n73. Among other things, the Railways will focus on four major areas, \nnamely : \n \n(i) Passenger safety; \n(ii) Capital and development works; \n(iii) Cleanliness; and \n(iv) Finance and accounting reforms. \n \n74. For passenger safety, a Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh will be created \nwith a corpus of ` 1 lakh crores over a period of 5 years.  Besides seed 17 \n \n \ncapital from the Government, the Railways will arrange the balance \nresources from their own revenues and other sources.  Government will lay \ndown clear cut guidelines and timeline for implementing various safety \nworks to be funded from this Kosh. Unmanned level crossings on Broad \nGauge lines will be eliminated by 2020.  Expert international assistance will \nbe harnessed to improve safety preparedness and maintenance practices. \n75. In the next 3 years, the throughput is proposed to be enhanced by \n10%.  This will be done through modernisation and upgradation of \nidentified corridors.  Railway lines of 3,500 kms will be commissioned in \n2017-18, as against 2,800 kms in 2016-17. Steps will be taken to launch \ndedicated trains for tourism and pilgrimage.   \n \n76. Railways have set up joint ventures with 9 State Governments. 70 \nprojects have been identified for construction and development.  \n \n77. A beginning has been made with regard to station redevelopment. \nAt least 25 stations are expected to be awarded during 2017-18 for station \nredevelopment.  500 stations will be made differently abled friendly by \nproviding lifts and escalators.   \n78. It is proposed to feed about 7,000 stations with solar power in the \nmedium term.  A beginning has already been made in 300 stations.  Works \nwill be taken up for 2,000 railway stations as part of 1000 MW solar \nmission.   \n \n79. Our focus is on swachh rail.  SMS based Clean My Coach Service  has \nbeen started.  It is now proposed t o introduce \u2018Coach Mitra\u2019 facility, a single \nwindow interface, to register all coach related complaints and \nrequirements.  By 2019, all coaches of Indian Railways will be fitted with bio \ntoilets.  Pilot plants for environment friendly disposal of solid waste and \nconversion of biodegradable waste to energy are being set up at New Delhi \nand Jaipur railway stations.  Five more such solid waste management plants \nare now being taken up. \n \n80. Today Indian Railways face stiff competition from other modes of \ntransportation which are dominated by the private sector.  Transformative \nmeasures have to be undertaken to make Indian Railways competitive to \nretain their position of pre-eminence. The following steps will therefore be \ntaken : \n \n(i) Railways will implement end to end integrated transport \nsolutions for select commodities through partnership with 18 \n \n \nlogistics players, who would provide both front and back end \nconnectivity.  Rolling stocks and practices will be customised to \ntransport perishable goods, especially agricultural products. \n(ii) Railways will offer competitive ticket booking facility to the \npublic at large. Service charge on e-tickets booked through IRCTC \nhas been withdrawn. Cashless reservations have gone up from \n58% to 68%.    \n(iii) As part of accounting reforms, accrual based financial \nstatements will be rolled out by March 2019.   \n81. It will be our continuous endeavour to improve the Operating Ratio \nof the Railways.  The tariffs of Railways would be fixed, taking into \nconsideration costs, quality of service, social obligations and competition \nfrom other forms of transport. \n82. Metro rail is emerging as an important mode of urban \ntransportation.  A new Metro Rail Policy will be announced with focus on \ninnovative models of implementation and financing, as well as \nstandardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software.  This will \nopen up new job opportunities for our youth.  \n83. A new Metro Rail Act will be enacted by rationalising the existing \nlaws.  This will facilitate greater private participation and investment in \nconstruction and operation.  \n \n84. In the road sector, I have stepped up the Budget allocation for \nhighways from `\n 57,976 crores in BE 2016-17 to ` 64,900 crores in 2017-18.   \n2,0\n00 kms of coastal connectivity roads have been identified for \nconstruction and development. This will facilitate better connectivity with \nports and remote villages.  The total length of roads, including those under \nPMGSY, built from 2014-15 till the current year is about 1,40,000 kms which \nis significantly higher than previous three years. \n \n85. An effective multi modal logistics and transport sector will make our \neconomy more competitive.  A specific programme for development of \nmulti-modal logistics parks, together with multi modal transport facilities, \nwill be drawn up and implemented.  \n \n86. Select airports in Tier 2 cities will be taken up for operation and \nmaintenance in the PPP mode.  Airport Authority of India Act will be 19 \n \n \namended to enable effective monetisation of land assets.  The resources, so \nraised, will be utilised for airport upgradation. \n \n87. For transportation sector as a whole, including rail, roads, shipping, I \nhave provided ` 2,41,387  crores in 2017-18.  This magnitude of investment \nwill spur a huge amount of economic activity across the country and create \nmore job opportunities. \n88. Telecom sector is an important component of our infrastructure eco \nsystem.  The recent spectrum auctions have removed spectrum scarcity in \nthe country.  This will give a major fillip to mobile broadband and Digital \nIndia for the benefit of people living in rural and remote areas.  \n \n89. Under the BharatNet Project, OFC has been laid in 1,55,000 kms.  I \nhave stepped up the allocation for BharatNet Project to ` 10,000 crores in \n2017-18.  By the end of 2017-18, high speed broadband connectivity on \noptical fibre will be available in more than 1,50,000 gram panchayats,   with \nwifi hot spots and access to digital services at low tariffs. A DigiGaon \ninitiative will be launched to provide tele-medicine, education and skills \nthrough digital technology.   \n \n90. For strengthening our Energy sector, Government has decided to set \nup Strategic Crude Oil Reserves.  In the first phase, 3 such Reserves facilities \nhave been set up.  Now in the second phase, it is proposed to set up caverns \nat 2 more locations, namely, Chandikhole in Odisha and Bikaner in \nRajasthan.  This will take our strategic reserve capacity to 15.33 MMT. \n \n91. In solar energy, we now propose to take up the second phase of \nSolar Park development for additional 20,000 MW capacity.  \n \n92. We are also creating an eco-system to mak\ne India a global hub for \nelectronics manufacturing.  Over 250 investment proposals for electronics \nmanufacturing have been received in the last 2 years, totalling an \ninvestment of `\n 1.26 lakh crores.  A number of global leaders and mobile \nmanufacturers have set up production facilities in India.  I have therefore \nexponentially increased the allocation for incentive schemes like M-SIPS and \nEDF to ` 745 crores in 2017-18.  This is an all-time high. \n \n93. We have to focus on our export infrastructure in a competitive \nworld.  A new and restructured Central scheme, namely, Trade \nInfrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) will be launched in 2017-18.  \n 20 \n \n \n94. The total allocation for infrastructure development in 2017- 18 \nstands at `3,96,135 crores. \nVI. FINANCIAL SECTOR  \n95. I now turn to the Financial Sector.  The focus of TEC India agenda in \nthis sector is on building stable and stronger institutions.  We will continue \nwith our reform agenda with several new measures.   \n \n96. Our Government has already undertaken substantive reforms in FDI \npolicy in the last two years.  More than 90% of the total FDI inflows are now \nthrough the automatic route.  The Foreign Investment Promotion Board \n(FIPB) has successfully implemented e-filing and online processing of FDI \napplications.  We have now reached a stage where FIPB can be phased out.  \nWe have therefore decided to abolish the FIPB in 2017-18.  A roadmap for \nthe same will be announced in the next few months.  In the meantime, \nfurther liberalisation of FDI policy is under consideration and necessary \nannouncements will be made in due course. \n \n97. The Commodities markets require further reforms for the benefits of \nfarmers.  An expert committee will be constituted to study and promote \ncreation of an operational and legal framework to integrate spot market \nand derivatives market for commodities trading.  e-NAM would be an \nintegral part of such framework.   \n \n98. The draft bill to curtail the menace of illicit deposit schemes has \nbeen placed in the public domain and will be introduced shortly after its \nfinalisation.  There is an urgent need to protect the poor and gullible \ninvestors from another set of dubious schemes, operated by unscrupulous \nentities who exploit the regulatory gaps in the Multi State Cooperative \nSocieties Act, 2002.  We will amend this Act in consultation with various \nstakeholders, as part of our \u2018Clean India\u2019 agenda. \n \n99. The bill relating to resolution of financial firms will be introduced in \nthe current Budget Session of Parliament.  This will contribute to stability \nand resilience of our financial system.  It will also protect the consumers of \nvarious financial institutions.  Together with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy \nCode, a resolution mechanism for financial firms will ensure \ncomprehensiveness of the resolution system in our country. \n \n100. I had stated in my last Budget speech that a Bill will be introduced to \nstreamline institutional arrangements for resolution of disputes in \ninfrastructure related construction contracts, PPP and public utility 21 \n \n \ncontracts.  After extensive stakeholders\u2019 consultations, we have decided \nthat the required mechanism would be instituted as part of the Arbitration \nand Conciliation Act 1996.  An amendment Bill will be introduced in this \nregard. \n \n101. Cyber security is critical for safeguarding the integrity and stability of \nour financial sector.  A Computer Emergency Response Team for our \nFinancial Sector (CERT-Fin) will be established.  This entity will work in close \ncoordination with all financial sector regulators and other stakeholders. \n102. I have also proposed several other measures in the financial sector \nwhich are listed in Annex I. \n \n103. Listing of Public Sector enterprises will foster greater public \naccountability and unlock the true value of these companies.  The \nGovernment will put in place a revised mechanism and procedure to ensure \ntime bound listing of identified CPSEs on stock exchanges. The \ndisinvestment policy announced by me in the last budget will continue. \n \n104. The shares of Railway PSEs like IRCTC, IRFC and IRCON will be listed \nin stock exchanges. \n \n105. We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs through \nconsolidation, mergers and acquisitions.  By these methods, the CPSEs can \nbe integrated across the value chain of an industry.  It will give them \ncapacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher \ninvestment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. \nPossibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector.  We \npropose to create an integrated public sector \u2018oil major\u2019 which will be able \nto match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil \nand gas companies. \n \n106. Our ETF, comprising shares of ten CPSEs, has received overwhelming \nresponse in the recent Further Fund Offering (FFO).  We will continue to use \nETF as a vehicle for further disinvestment of shares.  Accordingly, a new ETF \nwith diversified CPSE stocks and other Government holdings will be \nlaunched in 2017-18. \n \n107. The focus on resolution of stressed legacy accounts of Banks \ncontinues.  The legal framework has been strengthened to facilitate \nresolution, through the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code \nand the amendments to the SARFAESI and Debt Recovery Tribunal Acts.  In \nline with the \u2018Indradhanush\u2019 roadmap, I have provided ` 10,000 crores for 22 \n \n \nrecapitalisation of Banks in 2017-18.  Additional allocation will be provided, \nas may be required. \n \n108. Listing and trading of Security Receipts issued by a securitization \ncompany or a reconstruction company under the SARFAESI Act will be \npermitted in SEBI registered stock exchanges. This will enhance capital flows \ninto the securitization industry and will particularly be helpful to deal with \nbank NPAs. \n \n109.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana  has contributed significantly to \nfunding the unfunded and the underfunded.  Last year, the target of ` 1.22 \nlakh crores was exceeded.  For 2017-18, I propose to double the lending \ntarget of 2015-16 and set it at ` 2.44 lakh crores.   Priority will be given to \nDalits, Tribals, Backward Classes, Minorities and Women.  \n \n110.  The Stand Up India scheme was launched by our Government in \nApril 2016 to support Dalit, Tribal and Women entrepreneurs to set up \ngreenfield enterprises and become job creators.  Over 16,000 new \nenterprises have come up through this scheme in activities, as diverse as \nfood processing, garments, diagnostic centres, etc. \nVII. DIGITAL ECONOMY \n111. Promotion of a digital economy is an integral part of Government\u2019s \nstrategy to clean the system and weed out corruption and black money.  It \nhas a transformative impact in terms of greater formalisation of the \neconomy and mainstreaming of financial savings into the banking system.  \nThis, in turn, is expected to energise private investment in the country \nthrough lower cost of credit.  India is now on the cusp of a massive digital \nrevolution.   \n \n112. A shift to digital payments has huge benefits for the common man.  \nThe earlier initiative of our Government to promote financial inclusion and \nthe JAM trinity were important precursors to our current push for digital \ntransactions. \n \n113.  Already there is evidence of increased digital transactions.  The \nBHIM app has been launched. It will unleash the power of mobile phones \nfor digital payments and financial inclusion.  125 lakh people have adopted \nthe BHIM app so far. The Government will launch two new schemes to \npromote the usage of BHIM; these are, Referral Bonus Scheme for \nindividuals and a Cashback Scheme for merchants.   23 \n \n \n \n114. Aadhar Pay, a merchant version of Aadhar Enabled Payment System, \nwill be launched shortly.  This will be specifically beneficial for those who do \nnot have debit cards, mobile wallets and mobile phones.   A Mission will be \nset up with a target of 2,500 crore digital transactions for 2017-18 through \nUPI, USSD, Aadhar Pay, IMPS and debit cards. Banks have targeted to \nintroduce additional 10 lakh new PoS terminals by March 2017.  They will \nbe encouraged to introduce 20 lakh Aadhar based PoS by September 2017.    \n \n115. Increased digital transactions will enable small and micro enterprises \nto access formal credit.  Government will encourage SIDBI to refinance \ncredit institutions which provide unsecured loans, at reasonable interest \nrates, to borrowers based on their transaction history. \n \n116. The digital payment infrastructure and grievance handling \nmechanisms shall be strengthened.  The focus would be on rural and semi \nurban areas through Post Offices, Fair Price Shops and Banking \nCorrespondents.  Steps would be taken to promote and possibly mandate \npetrol pumps, fertilizer depots, municipalities, Block offices, road transport \noffices, universities, colleges, hospitals and other institutions to have \nfacilities for digital payments, including BHIM App.  A proposal to mandate \nall Government receipts through digital means, beyond a prescribed limit, is \nunder consideration.   \n \n117. Government will strengthen the Financial Inclusion Fund to augment \nresources for taking up these initiatives. \n \n118. Government will consider and work with various stakeholders for \nearly implementation of the interim recommendations of the Committee of \nChief Ministers on digital transactions.   \n \n119. The Committee on Digital Payments constituted by Department of \nEconomic Affairs has recommended structural reforms in the payment eco \nsystem, including amendments to the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, \n2007.  Government will undertake a comprehensive review of this Act and \nbring about appropriate amendments.  To begin with, it is proposed to \ncreate a Payments Regulatory Board in the Reserve Bank of India by \nreplacing the existing Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and \nSettlement Systems.  Necessary amendments are proposed to this effect in \nthe Finance Bill 2017.  \n \n120. As we move faster on the path of digital transactions and cheque \npayments, we need to ensure that the payees of dishonoured cheques are 24 \n \n \nable to realise the payments. Government is therefore considering the \noption of amending the Negotiable Instruments Act suitably. \n \nVIII. PUBLIC SERVICE \n121. I now turn to Public Service.  Our focus here is on effective \ngovernment and efficient service delivery.  \n \n122. We have made a strong beginning with regard to Direct Benefit \nTransfer (DBT) to LPG and kerosene consumers.  Chandigarh and eight \ndistricts of Haryana have become kerosene free.  84 Government schemes \nhave also boarded on the DBT platform.   \n \n123. The Government e-market place which is now functional for \nprocurement of goods and services, has been selected as one of the \nwinners of the South Asia Procurement Innovation Awards of the World \nBank. \n  \n124. Our citizens in far flung regions of the country find it difficult to \nobtain passports and redress passport related grievances.  We have decided \nto utilise the Head Post Offices as front offices for rendering passport \nservices.  \n \n125. Our defence forces keep the country safe from both external and \ninternal threats.  A Centralised Defence Travel System has now been \ndeveloped through which travel tickets can be booked online by our \nsoldiers and officers.  They do not have to face the hassle of standing in \nqueues with railway warrants. \n \n126. A comprehensive web based interactive Pension Disbursement \nSystem for Defence Pensioners will be established.  This system will receive \npension proposals and make payments centrally.   This will reduce the \ngrievances of defence pensioners. \n \n127. At present our citizens, especially those belonging to the poor and \nunprivileged sections, go through cumbersome procedures of Government \nrecruitment.  There are multiplicity of agencies and examinations.  We \npropose to introduce a system of single registration and two tier system of \nexamination.  \n 25 \n \n \n128. Over the years, the number of tribunals have multiplied with \noverlapping functions.  We propose to rationalise the number of tribunals \nand merge tribunals wherever appropriate. \n \n129. In the recent past, there have been instances of big time offenders, \nincluding economic offenders, fleeing the country to escape the reach of \nlaw. We have to ensure that the law is allowed to take its own course. \nGovernment is therefore considering introduction of legislative changes, or \neven a new law, to confiscate the assets of such persons located within the \ncountry, till they submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal forum. \nNeedless to say that all necessary constitutional safeguards will be followed \nin such cases. \n \n130. Our Government will continue to remain committed to improve the \nstandards of public service and transparent governance.  Service to the \npeople was the life-long commitment of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma \nGandhi.  As we approach, the 150th Birth Anniversary of the Mahatma, we \nwill take all steps to celebrate it in a befitting manner.  A High Level \nCommittee under the Chairmanship of Honourable Prime Minister is \nproposed to be set up for the same.  We will also commemorate the \ncentenary year of Champaran Satyagrah this year. Government of India will \nsupport Government of Gujarat to commemorate 100 years of Sabarmati \nAshram in 2017, in a befitting manner. 200 years ago in 1817, a valiant \nuprising of soldiers led by Buxi Jagabandhu took place in Khordha  of \nOdisha.  We will commemorate the same appropriately. \n \nIX.  PRUDENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT \n131. I now turn to the fiscal situation in the context of the Budget for \n2017-18.   \n \n132. The total expenditure in Budget for 2017-18 has been placed at \n`\n21.47 lakh crores. With the abolition of Plan-Non Plan classification of \nexpenditure, the focus is now on Revenue and Capital expenditure.  I have \nstepped up the allocation for Capital expenditure by 25.4% over the \nprevious year. This will have multiplier effects and lead to higher growth.  \nThe total resources being transferred to the States and the Union Territories \nwith Legislatures is ` 4.11 lakh crores, against `\n 3.60 lakh crores in BE 2016-\n17. Details of allocations for important sectors and schemes and transfer of \nresources to States are given in Annex II of my Speech. \n \n133. I have made a provision of ` 3,000 crores under the Department of \nEconomic Affairs to implement various Budget announcements and other 26 \n \n \nnew schemes in 2017-18.   For Defence expenditure excluding pensions, I \nhave provided a sum of ` 2,74,114 crores including ` 86,488  crores for \nDefence capital. I have increased the allocation for Scientific Ministries to \n`\n 37,435 crore in 2017-18. \n \n134. For the first time, a consolidated Outcome Budget, covering all \nMinistries and Departments, is being laid along with the other Budget \ndocuments. This will improve accountability of Government expenditure. \n \n135. The FRBM Review Committee has given its report recently.  The \nCommittee has done an elaborate exercise and has recommended that a \nsustainable debt path must be the principal macro-economic anchor of our \nfiscal policy.  The Committee has favoured Debt to GDP of 60% for the \nGeneral Government by 2023, consisting of 40% for Central Government \nand 20% for State Governments.  Within this framework, the Committee \nhas derived and recommended 3% fiscal deficit for the next three years.  \nThe Committee has also provided for \u2018Escape Clauses\u2019, for deviations upto \n0.5% of GDP, from the stipulated fiscal deficit target.  Among the triggers \nfor taking recourse to these Escape Clauses, the Committee has included \n\u201cfar-reaching structural reforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal \nimplications\u201d as one of the factors.  Although there is a strong case now to \ninvoke this Escape Clause, I am refraining from doing so.  The Report of the \nCommittee will be carefully examined and appropriate decisions taken in \ndue course.   \n \n136. Nevertheless, I take note of the fiscal deficit roadmap of 3% \nrecommended by the Committee for the next three years.  I have taken into \nconsideration the need for higher public expenditure in the context of \nsluggish private sector investment and slow global growth.  I have kept in \nmind the recommendation of the Committee that a sustainable debt should \nbe the underlying basis of prudent fiscal management.  Considering all \nthese aspects, I have pegged the fiscal deficit for 2017-18 at 3.2% of GDP \nand remain committed to achieve 3% in the following year.  With this \ngradual approach, I have ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation, without \ncompromising the requirements of public investment.  \n \n137. I have taken due care to limit the net market borrowing of \nGovernment to ` 3.48 lakh crores after buyback, much lower than ` 4.25 \nlakh crores of the previous year.  More importantly, the Revenue Deficit of \n2.3% in BE 2016-17 stands reduced to 2 .1% in the Revised Estimates.  The \nRevenue Deficit for next year is pegged at 1.9% , against 2% mandated by \nthe FRBM Act. \n 27 \n \n \n138. It will be our endeavour to improve upon these fiscal numbers, \nespecially the fiscal deficit, in the next year, through greater focus on \nquality of expenditure and higher tax realisation from the huge cash \ndeposits in Banks, triggered by demonetisation.   \n  28 \n \n \nPART  B \nMadam Speaker, \n139. I shall now present my tax proposals: \n140. India\u2019s tax to GDP ratio is very low, and the proportion of direct tax \nto indirect tax is not optimal from the view point of social justice. I place \nbefore you certain data to indicate that our direct tax collection is not \ncommensurate with the income and consumption pattern of Indian \neconomy.  As against estimated 4.2 crore persons engaged in organised \nsector employment, the number of individuals filing return for salary \nincome are only 1.74 crore.   As against 5.6 crore informal sector individual \nenterprises and firms doing small business in India, the number of returns \nfiled by this category are only 1.81 crore.  Out of the 13.94 lakh companies \nregistered in India upto 31st March, 2014, 5.97 lakh companies have filed \ntheir returns for Assessment Year 2016-17. Of the 5.97 lakh companies \nwhich have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17 so far, as many \nas 2.76 lakh companies have shown losses or zero income.  2.85 lakh \ncompanies have shown profit before tax of less than `\n 1 crore.  28,667 \ncompanies have shown profit between ` 1 crore to ` 10 crore, and only \n7781 companies have profit before tax of more than ` 10 crores. \n141. Among the 3.7 crore individuals who filed the tax returns in  \n2015-16, 99 lakh show income below the exemption limit of ` 2.5 lakh p.a., \n1.95 crore show income between ` 2.5 to ` 5 lakh, 52 lakh show income \nbetween ` 5 to ` 10 lakhs and only 24 lakh people show income above ` 10 \nlakhs.  Of the 76 lakh individual assesses who declare income above ` 5 \nlakh, 56 lakh are in the salaried class. The number of people showing \nincome more than ` 50 lakh in the entire country is only 1.72 lakh.  We can \ncontrast this with the fact that in the last five years, more than 1.25 crore \ncars have been sold, and number of Indian citizens who flew abroad, either \nfor business or tourism, is 2 crore in the year 2015.  From all these figures \nwe can conclude that we are largely a tax non-compliant society.  The \npredominance of cash in the economy makes it possible for the people to \nevade their taxes.  When too many people evade taxes, the burden of their \nshare falls on those who are honest and compliant. \n142. After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received \nin respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing \npicture.  During the period 8 th November to 30 th December 2016, deposits \nbetween ` 2 lakh and ` 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts \nwith an average deposit size of ` 5.03 lakh.  Deposits of more than 80 lakh \nwere made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of `\n 3.31 crores.  29 \n \n \nThis data mining will help us immensely in expanding the tax net as well as \nincreasing the revenues, which was one of the objectives of \ndemonetisation.  \n143. Madam Speaker, one of the main priorities of our Government is to \neliminate the black money component from the economy.  We are \ncommitted to make our taxation rates more reasonable, our tax \nadministration more fair and expand the tax base in the country.  This \napproach will change the colour of money.  \nx\u00c9<\u00c7 n\u00d6\u00c9\u00cax\u00c9\u00aa\u00c9\u00c9 c\u00e8, x\u00c9\u00aa\u00c9\u00c9 n\u00c9\u00e8\u00ae c\u00e8, x\u00c9\u00aa\u00c9\u00c9\u00d2 c\u00e8 =\u00e0\u00c9\u00c6M\u00c9 \nB\u00c9\u00d6EU l\u00c9\u00e4 {\u00c9c\u00e3\u00c9\u00e4 B\u00c9\u00e4E i\u00c9\u00ae\u00c9\u00d2B\u00c9\u00e4E, i\u00c9\u00c9\u00e4 c\u00e9 B\u00c9\u00d6EU +\u00c9\u00c9V\u00c9 B\u00c9\u00e4E f\u00c6M\u00c9 \n\u00ae\u00c9\u00e4\u00b6\u00c9x\u00c9\u00c9\u00d2 +\u00c9\u00c9B\u00c9\u00e4E +\u00c9\u00c6v\u00c9\u00e4\u00ae\u00c9\u00e5 \u00ba\u00c9\u00e4 V\u00c9\u00c9\u00e4 ]B\u00c9E\u00ae\u00c9\u00aa\u00c9\u00c9\u00d2 c\u00e8 \nB\u00c9E\u00c9\u00e3\u00c9\u00e4 v\u00c9x\u00c9 B\u00c9E\u00c9\u00e4 \u00a3\u00c9\u00c9\u00d2 \u00a4\u00c9n\u00e3\u00c9x\u00c9\u00c9 {\u00c9\u00bd\u00c9, +\u00c9\u00c9V\u00c9 +\u00c9{\u00c9x\u00c9\u00c9 \u00ae\u00c6M\u00c9 \n144. The net tax revenue of 2013-14 was `\n 11.38 lakh crores.  This grew \nby 9.4% in 2014-15 and 17% in 2015-16.  As per the RE of 2016-17, we will \nend the year with a high growth rate of 17% for the second year in a row.  \nBecause of the serious efforts made by the Government, the rate of growth \nof advance tax in personal income tax in the first three quarters of the \ncurrent financial is 34.8%.  \n145. Madam Speaker, the thrust of my tax proposals in this Budget is \nstimulating growth, relief to middle class, affordable housing, curbing black \nmoney, promoting digital economy, transparency of political funding and \nsimplification of tax administration. \nMeasures for Promoting Affordable Housing and Real Estate Sector \n146. In my budget proposals last year, I had announced a scheme for \nprofit-linked income tax exemption for promoters of affordable housing \nscheme which has received a very good response.  However, in order to \nmake this scheme more attractive, I propose certain changes in the scheme.  \nFirst of all, instead of built up area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr., the carpet area of \n30 and 60 sq.mtr. will be counted.  Also the 30 sq.mtr. limit will apply only \nin case of municipal limits of 4 metropolitan cities while for the rest of the \ncountry including in the peripheral areas of metros, limit of 60 sq.mtr.  will \napply.  In order to be eligible,\n the scheme was to be completed in 3 years \nafter commencement.  I propose to extend this period to 5 years.  \n147. At present, the houses which are unoccupied after getting \ncompletion certificates are subjected to tax on notional rental income.  For \nbuilders for whom constructed buildings are stock-in-trade, I propose to 30 \n \n \napply this rule only after one year of the end of the year in which \ncompletion certificate is received so that they get some breathing time for \nliquidating their inventory. \n148. We also propose to make a number of changes in the capital gain \ntaxation provisions in respect of land and building. The holding period for \nconsidering gain from immovable property to be long term is 3 years now.  \nThis is proposed to be reduced to 2 years.  Also, the base year for \nindexation is proposed to be shifted from 1.4.1981 to 1.4.2001 for all \nclasses of assets including immovable property.  This move will significantly \nreduce the capital gain tax liability while encouraging the mobility of assets. \nWe also plan to extend the basket of financial instruments in which the \ncapital gains can be invested without payment of tax.  \n149. For Joint Development Agreement signed for development of \nproperty, the liability to pay capital gain tax will arise in the year the project \nis completed.   \n150. The new capital for State of Andhra Pradesh is being constructed by \ninnovative land-pooling mechanism without use of the Land Acquisition Act. \nI propose to exempt from capital gain tax, persons holding land on 2.6.2014, \nthe date on which the State of Andhra Pradesh was reorganised, and whose \nland is being pooled for creation of capital city under the Government \nscheme.  \nMeasures for Stimulating Growth  \n151. A concessional with-holding rate of 5% is being charged on interest \nearned by foreign entities in external commercial borrowings or in bonds \nand Government securities.  This concession is available till 30.6.2017.  I \npropose to extend it to 30.6.2020.  This benefit is also extended to Rupee \nDenominated (Masala) Bonds.  \n152. The Government gave income tax exemptions to start-ups with \ncertain conditions last year. For the purpose of carry forward of losses in \nrespect of such start-ups, the condition of continuous holding of 51% of \nvoting rights has been relaxed subject to the condition that the holding of \nthe original promoter/promoters continues.  Also the profit linked \ndeduction available to the start-ups for 3 years out of 5 years is being \nchanged to 3 years out of 7 years. \n153. Minimum Alternate Tax is at present levied as an advance tax.  There \nis a strong demand for abolition of MAT.  Although the plan for phasing out \nof exemptions will kick in from 1.4.2017, the full benefit of revenue out of \nphase-out will be available to Government only after 7 to 10 years when all 31 \n \n \nthose who are already availing exemptions at present complete their period \nof availment.  Therefore, it is not practical to remove or reduce MAT at \npresent.  However, in order to allow companies to use MAT credit in future \nyears, I propose to allow carry forward of MAT upto a period of 15 years \ninstead of 10 years at present.  \n154. In my Budget proposals in 2015, I had announced that I would be \nbringing the corporate income tax rate down to 25% gradually.  In 2016 \nBudget, I had announced a reduction by 1% in case of those companies \nwhose turnover is less than `\n 5 crore.  In the same Budget, I had also \nannounced that new manufacturing companies who do not avail of any \nexemption would be charged only 25% income tax.  \n155. Medium and Small Enterprises occupy bulk of economic activities \nand are also instrumental in providing maximum employment to people.  \nHowever, since they do not get many exemptions, they end up paying \nmore taxes as compared to large companies.  As per data of financial year \n2015-16, 2.85 lakh companies making profit of less than `\n 1 crore pay \neffective tax rate of 30.26% while 298 companies making profit above ` 500 \ncrores pay effective tax rate of 25.90%. \n156. In order to make MSME companies more viable and also to \nencourage firms to migrate to company format, I propose to reduce the \nincome tax for smaller companies with annual turnover upto `\n 50 crore to \n25%.  As per data of Assessment Year 2015-16, there are 6.94 lakh \ncompanies filing returns of which 6.67 lakh companies fall in this category \nand, therefore, percentage-wise 96% of companies will get this benefit of \nlower taxation. This will make our MSME sector more competitive as \ncompared to large companies.  The revenue forgone estimate for this \nmeasure is expected to be `\n 7,200 crore per annum. \n157. In order to give a boost to banking sector, I propose to increase \nallowable provision for Non-Performing Asset from 7.5% to 8.5%.  This will \nreduce the tax liability of banks.  I also propose to tax interest receivable on \nactual receipt instead of accrual basis in respect of NPA accounts of all non-\nscheduled cooperative banks also at par with scheduled banks. This will \nremove hardship of having to pay tax even when interest income is not \nrealised. \n158. Considering the wide range of use of LNG as fuel as well as feed \nstock for petro-chemicals sector, I propose to reduce the basic customs \nduty on LNG from 5% to 2.5%. 32 \n \n \n159. In order to incentivise domestic value addition and to promote Make \nin India, I propose to make changes in Customs & Central Excise duties in \nrespect of certain items which are given in the Annex III  of this speech.  \nSome of these proposals are also for addressing duty inversion. \nPromoting Digital Economy  \n160. There is a scheme of presumptive income tax for small and medium \ntax payers whose turnover is upto ` 2 crores.  At present, 8% of their \nturnover is counted as presumptive income.  I propose to make this 6% in \nrespect of turnover which is received by non-cash means. This benefit will \nbe applicable for transactions undertaken in the current year also. \n161. I propose to limit the cash expenditure allowable as deduction, both \nfor revenue as well as capital expenditure, to `\n 10,000.  Similarly, the limit \nof cash donation which can be received by a charitable trust is being \nreduced from `\n 10,000/- to ` 2000/-. \n162. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the Government for \nblack money has suggested that no transaction above ` 3 lakh should be \npermitted in cash.  The Government has decided to accept this proposal.  \nSuitable amendment to the Income-tax Act is proposed in the Finance Bill \nfor enforcing this decision. \n163. To promote cashless transactions, I propose to exempt BCD, \nExcise/CV duty and SAD on miniaturised POS card reader for m-POS, micro \nATM standards version 1.5.1, Finger Print Readers/Scanners and Iris \nScanners. Simultaneously, I also propose to exempt parts and components \nfor manufacture of such devices, so as to encourage domestic \nmanufacturing of these devices. \nTransparency in Electoral Funding  \n164. India is the world\u2019s largest democracy.  Political parties are an \nessential ingredient of a multi-party Parliamentary democracy.  Even 70 \nyears after Independence, the country has not been able to evolve a \ntransparent method of funding political parties which is vital to the system \nof free and fair elections.  An attempt was made in the past by amending \nthe provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, the Companies Act and \nthe Income Tax Act to incentivise donations by individuals, partnership \nfirms, HUFs and companies to political parties.  Both the donor and the \ndonee were granted exemption from payment of tax if the accounts were \ntransparently maintained and returns were filed with the competent \nauthorities.  Additionally, a list of donors who contributed more than \n`\n20,000/- to any party in cash or cheque is required to be maintained.  The 33 \n \n \nsituation has only marginally improved since these provisions were brought \ninto force.  Political parties continue to receive most of their funds through \nanonymous donations which are shown in cash. \n165. An effort, therefore, requires to be made to cleanse the system of \npolitical funding in India.  Donors have also expressed reluctance in \ndonating by cheque or other transparent methods as it would disclose their \nidentity and entail adverse consequences.  I, therefore, propose the \nfollowing scheme as an effort to cleanse the system of funding of political \nparties: \na) In accordance with the suggestion made by the Election Commission, \nthe maximum amount of cash donation that a political party can \nreceive will be `\n2000/- from one person. \nb) Political parties will be entitled to receive donations by cheque or \ndigital mode from their donors. \nc) As an additional step, an amendment is being proposed to the \nReserve Bank of India Act to enable the issuance of electoral bonds in \naccordance with a scheme that the Government of India would frame \nin this regard.  Under this scheme, a donor could purchase bonds \nfrom authorised banks against cheque and digital payments only.  \nThey shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a \nregistered political party.  These bonds will be redeemable within the \nprescribed time limit from issuance of bond.  \nd) Every political party would have to file its return within the time \nprescribed in accordance with the provision of the Income-tax Act.   \nNeedless to say that the existing exemption to the political parties from \npayment of income-tax would be available only subject to the fulfilment of \nthese conditions.  This reform will bring about greater transparency and \naccountability in political funding, while preventing future generation of \nblack money. \nEase of Doing Business  \n166. As an anti-avoidance measure, the provision of domestic transfer \npricing in respect of related entities was brought in the Finance Act of 2012.  \nSince then the number of entities being covered under domestic pricing has \ngone up substantially necessitating a longer scrutiny, which causes hardship \nto domestic companies.  In order to reduce the compliance burden due to \ndomestic transfer pricing provisions, I propose to restrict the scope of \ndomestic transfer pricing only if one of the entities involved in related party \ntransaction enjoys specified profit-linked deduction.   34 \n \n \n167. I propose to increase the threshold limit for audit of business \nentities who opt for presumptive income scheme from `1 crore to `2 \ncrores.  Similarly, the threshold for maintenance of books for individuals \nand HUF is being increased from turnover of `10 lakhs to `25 lakhs or \nincome from `1.2 lakhs to `2.5 lakhs.  \n168. In 2012, Income-tax Act was amended to provide for taxation of \nthose transactions of transfer of shares or interest in a foreign entity \nderiving its value substantially from Indian assets.  Apprehensions have \nbeen raised about some difficulties which arise because of this provision in \ncase of transfer of stake of investors of India-based funds located abroad \nbut investing in India-based companies.   \n169. In order to remove this difficulty, I propose to exempt Foreign \nPortfolio Investor (FPI) Category I & II from indirect transfer provision.  I also \npropose to issue a clarification that indirect transfer provision shall not \napply in case of redemption of shares or interests outside India as a result \nof or arising out of redemption or sale of investment in India which is \nchargeable to tax in India.   \n170. As on today, a TDS of 5% is being deducted from commission \npayable to individual insurance agents even if the income of some of them \nmay be below taxable limit.  I propose to exempt them from the \nrequirement of TDS subject to their filing a self-declaration that their \nincome is below taxable limit.  \n171. Last year, I had announced a new scheme for presumptive taxation \nfor professionals with receipt upto `\n50 lakhs p.a.  In respect of such \nassesses, they are being given further benefit in terms of paying advance \ntax in one instalment instead of four.  \n172. In order to allow the people to claim the refund expeditiously, the \ntime period for revising a tax return is being reduced to 12 months from \ncompletion of financial year, at par with the time period for filing of return.  \nAlso the time for completion of scrutiny assessments is being compressed \nfurther from 21 months to 18 months for Assessment Year 2018-19 and \nfurther to 12 months for Assessment Year 2019-20 and thereafter. \nPersonal Income-Tax \n173. While the Government is trying to bring within tax-net more people \nwho are evading taxes, the present burden of taxation is mainly on honest \ntax payers and salaried employees who are showing their income correctly.  \nTherefore, post-demonetisation, there is a legitimate expectation of this \nclass of people to reduce their burden of taxation.  Also an argument is 35 \n \n \nmade that if a nominal rate of taxation is kept for lower slab, many more \npeople will prefer to come within the tax net.   \n174. I, therefore, propose to reduce the existing rate of taxation for \nindividual assesses between income of `2.5 lakhs to `5 lakhs to 5% from the \npresent rate of 10%.  This would reduce the tax liability of all persons below \n`5 lakh income either to zero (with rebate) or 50% of their existing liability.  \nIn order not to have duplication of benefit, the existing benefit of rebate \navailable to the same group of beneficiaries is being reduced to `2500 \navailable only to assessees upto income of `3.5 lakhs.  The combined effect \nof both these measures will mean that there would be zero tax liability for \npeople getting income upto `3 lakhs p.a. and the tax liability will only be \n`2,500 for people with income between `3 and `3.5 lakhs.  If the limit of \n`1.5 lakh under Section 80C for investment is used fully the tax would be \nzero for people with income of `4.5 lakhs.  While the taxation liability of \npeople with income upto `5 lakhs is being reduced to half, all the other \ncategories of tax payers in the subsequent slabs will also get a uniform \nbenefit of `12,500/- per person. The total amount of tax foregone on \naccount of this measure is `15,500 crores. \n175.  In order to make good some of this revenue loss on account of this \nrelief, I propose to levy a surcharge of 10% of tax payable on categories of \nindividuals whose annual taxable income is between `50 lakhs and `1 crore.  \nThe existing surcharge of 15% of Tax on people earning more than `1 crore \nwill continue.  This is likely to give additional revenue of `2,700 crores.   \n176. In order to expand tax net, I also plan to have a simple one-page \nform to be filed as Income Tax Return for the category of individuals having \ntaxable income upto `5 lakhs other than business income.  Also a person of \nthis category who files income tax return for the first time would not be \nsubjected to any scrutiny in the first year unless there is specific information \navailable with the Department regarding his high value transaction.  I \nappeal to all citizens of India to contribute to Nation Building by making a \nsmall payment of 5% tax if their income is falling in the lowest slab of `\n2.5 \nlakhs to `5 lakhs. \n177. Some other important proposals for amendment in Tax Laws which \nare not covered by me in my speech are given in Annex III of this speech. \nGoods and Services Tax \n178. There has been substantial progress towards ushering in GST, by far, \nthe biggest tax reform since independence. Since the enactment of the \nConstitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, the \npreparatory work for this path-breaking reform has been a top priority for 36 \n \n \nthe Government. In this context, several teams of officers both from the \nStates and Central Board of Excise and Customs have been working \ntirelessly to give finishing touch to the Model GST law and rules and other \ndetails. Government on its part has promptly given effect to various \nprovisions of the Constitutional Amendment Act, including constitution of \nthe GST Council. Since then, the GST Council held 9 meetings to discuss \nvarious issues relating to GST, including broad contours of the GST rate \nstructure, threshold exemption and parameters for composition scheme, \ndetails for compensation to States due to implementation of GST, \nexamination of draft model GST law, draft IGST law and the Compensation \nLaw and administrative mechanism for GST. It is my privilege to inform this \naugust house that the GST Council has finalised its recommendations on \nalmost all the issues based on consensus and after spirited debate and \ndiscussions. The preparation of IT system for GST is also on schedule.  The \nextensive reach-out efforts to trade and industry for GST will start from 1st \nApril, 2017 to make them aware of the new taxation system. \n179. Centre, through the Central Board of Excise & Customs, shall \ncontinue to strive to achieve the goal of implementation of GST as per \nschedule without compromising the spirit of co-operative federalism.  \nImplementation of GST is likely to bring more taxes both to Central and \nState Governments because of widening of tax net.  I have preferred not to \nmake many changes in current regime of Excise & Service Tax because the \nsame are to be replaced by GST soon. \nRAPID \n180. In the Annual Conclave of Tax officers called \u2018Rajaswa Gyan Sangam\u2019 \nheld in June 2016, the Prime Minister had expressed his desire to bring \nreforms in tax administration in the form of an approach  of RAPID which \nstands for Revenue, Accountability, Probity, Information and Digitisation. \nThis approach precisely reflects the strategy of Tax Department which is \nnow formulated.  While revenue considerations always remain the focus of \nRevenue Department, we are trying to bring in maximum use of \nInformation Technology to remove human contact with assesses as well as \nto plug tax avoidance.  We will try to maximise our efforts for e-assessment \nin the coming year.  We are also using a lot of data mining capability, both \nin-house and outsourced.  We plan to enforce greater accountability of \nofficers of Tax Department for specific act of commission and omission. I \nwould like to assure everyone that honest, tax-compliant person would be \ntreated with dignity and courtesy.  \n181. Madam Speaker, my direct tax proposals for exemptions, etc. would \nresult in revenue loss of `\n22,700 crore but after counting for revenue gain 37 \n \n \nof `2,700 crore for additional resource mobilisation proposal, the net \nrevenue loss in direct tax would come to `20,000 crore.  There is no \nsignificant loss or gain in my indirect tax proposals.  \nCONCLUSION  \n182. Madam Speaker , I have outlined the Budget proposals under our \noverarching agenda: \u201cTransform, Energise and Clean India\u201d.  Our emphasis \nwill now be on implementing all these proposals   for the benefit of the \nfarmers, the poor and the underprivileged sections of our society. \n 183. Madam Speaker , it is said : \u201cWhen my aim is right, when my goal is \nin sight, the winds favour me and I fly\u201d.   There is no other day, which is \nmore appropriate for this, than today.  \n184. With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the \nHouse. \n \n \n  38 \n \n \nAnnex I to Part A \nOther measures in the Financial Sector \n1. The commodities and securities derivative markets will be further \nintegrated by integrating the participants, brokers, and operational \nframeworks. \n2. The process of registration of financial market intermediaries like \nmutual funds, brokers, portfolio managers, etc. will be made fully \nonline by SEBI. This will improve ease of doing business. \n3. A common application form for registration, opening of bank and \ndemat accounts, and issue of PAN will be introduced for Foreign \nPortfolio Investors (FPIs).  SEBI, RBI and CBDT will jointly put in place \nthe necessary systems and procedures.  This will greatly enhance \noperational flexibility and ease of access to Indian capital markets. \n4. Steps will be taken for linking of individual demat accounts with \nAadhar. \n5. Presently institutions such as banks and insurance companies are \ncategorised as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) by SEBI.  They are \neligible for participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked \nallocations. It is now proposed to allow systemically important \nNBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be \ncategorised as QIBs.
