    "content": "3\nrecapitalisation of the banks.  T his will address those sectors  w h i c h  n e e d\nimmediate attention.  Once the Go vernment discharges these prior ity\nobligations, it shall then focus on other areas which are also of utmost\npriority to the Government.\n10. While increasing the outlay of var ious social sector programmes, the\nGovernment will undertake three major schemes to help the weaker sections\nof the society.  The Pradhan Mant ri Fasal Bima Yojana has alrea dy been\nannounced to protect the farmer from the adverse consequences of nature.\nThe farmer will pay a nominal amount of insurance premium and get  t h e\nhighest ever compensation in the event of any loss suffered. A health\ninsurance scheme which protects one-third of India\u2019s population  against\nhospitalisation expenditure is also being announced.  The Government is\nalso launching a new initiative to ensure that the BPL families  a r e\nprovided with a cooking gas connection, supported by a Government\nsubsidy. This will significantly improve the health of women and those BPL\nfamilies who suffer adversely from the ill-effects of Chulha cooking.\n11. The Annual Budget is also an opportunity for the Government to\noutline its priorities for the year to come.  The priority of o ur Government is\nclearly to provide additional resources for vulnerable sections , rural areas\nand social and physical infrastructure creation.  The Governmen t shall also\nendeavour to continue with the o ngoing reform programme and ens ure the\npassage of the Constitutional amendments to enable the implemen tation of\nthe Goods and Service Tax, the passage of Insolvency and Bankru ptcy law\nand other important reform measur e s  w h i c h  a r e  p e n d i n g  b e f o r e  t he\nParliament.\n12. Additionally, as I will elaborate later, we will undertake significant\nreforms, such as the enactment of a law to ensure that all Gove rnment\nbenefits are conferred upon persons who deserve it, by giving a  statutory\nbacking to the AADHAR platform;  bringing significant changes in the\nlegislative framework relating to the transport sector so as to  free it from\nconstraints and restrictions; incentivising gas discovery and exploration by\nproviding calibrated marketing freedom; enactment of a comprehensive law\nto deal with resolution of financial firms; providing legal fra mework for\ndispute resolution in PPP projects and public utility contracts ; undertaking\nimportant banking sector reforms  and public listing  of general insurance\ncompanies; and undertaking significant changes in FDI policy.\n13. Our agenda for the next year is, therefore, to \u2018Transform India\u2019 in this\ndirection. My Budget proposals ar e, therefore, built on this tr ansformative\nagenda with nine distinct pillars.  These include:4\n(i) Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare:  with focus on doubling\nfarmers\u2019 income in five years;\n(ii) Rural Sector: with emphasis on rural employment and\ninfrastructure;\n(iii) Social Sector including Hea lthcare:  to cover all under welfare\nand health services;\n(iv) Education, Skills and Job Creation:  to make India a\nknowledge based and productive society;\n(v) Infrastructure and Investment: to enhance efficiency and\nquality of life;\n(vi) Financial Sector Reforms: to bring transparency and stability;\n(vii) Governance and Ease of Doing Business: to enable the peopl e\nto realise their full potential;\n(viii) Fiscal Discipline:  prudent management of Government\nfinances and delivery of benefits to the needy; and\n(ix) Tax Reforms: to reduce compliance burden with faith in the\ncitizenry.\nIn each of these themes, I shall outline specific policy measures and\ninitiatives which would have a transformative impact on our eco nomy and\nthe lives of our people.\nI. Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare\n14. Let me first take up Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare.  We are\ngrateful to our farmers for being the backbone of the country\u2019s  food security.\nWe need to think beyond \u2018food security\u2019 and give back to our fa rmers a\nsense of \u2018income security\u2019. Government will, therefore, reorien t its\ninterventions in the farm and non-farm sectors to double the in come of the\nfarmers by 2022.  Our total allocation for Agriculture and Farm ers\u2019 welfare\nis \u0001 35,984 crore.\n15. We need to address issues of optimal utilisation of our water\nresources; create new infrastructure for irrigation; conserve s oil fertility with\nbalanced use of fertilizer; and provide value addition and conn ectivity from\nfarm to markets.\n16. Irrigation is a critical input for increasing agriculture produ ction and\nproductivity.  Out of 141 million hectares of net cultivated ar ea in the\ncountry, only 46% is covered with irrigation.5\n17. The \u2018Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana\u2019 has been strengthened\nand will be implemented in mission mode. 28.5 lakh hectares will be brought\nunder irrigation under this Scheme.\n18. Implementation of 89 irrigation projects under AIBP, which have\nbeen languishing, will be fast tracked. This will help to irrigate 80.6 lakh\nhectares. These projects require \u000117,000 crore next year and \u000186,500 crore\nin the next five years. We will ensure that 23 of these projects are completed\nbefore 31st March, 2017.\n19. A dedicated Long Term Irrigation Fund will be created in\nNABARD with an initial corpus of about \u0001\u000120,000 crore.  To achieve all\nt h e s e ,  a  t o t a l  p r o v i s i o n  o f\u000112,517 crore has been made through\nbudgetary support and market borrowings in 2016-17.\n20. Simultaneously a major progr amme for sustainable management\nof ground water resources has been prepared with an estimated c ost of\n\u00016,000 crore and proposed for multilateral funding.\n21. At least 5 lakh farm ponds and dug wells in rain fed areas and 10 lakh\ncompost pits for production of o rganic manure will be taken up by making\nproductive use of the allocations under MGNREGA.\n22. The Soil Health Card Scheme is now being implemented with great er\nvigour.  Through this, farmers get information about nutrient l evel of the soil\nand can make judicious use of fertilizers.  The target is to cover all 14 crore\nfarm holdings by March 2017. \u0001368 crore has been provided for National\nProject on Soil Health and Fertilit y. Besides, 2,000 model retail outlets of\nFertilizer companies will be provided with soil and seed testin g facilities\nduring the next three years.  Fertilizer companies will also co -market city\ncompost which increases the efficacy of chemical fertilizer. A policy for\nconversion of city waste into compost has also been approved by  t h e\nGovernment under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.\n23. To increase crop yields in rain fed areas, which account for nea rly\n55% of the country\u2019s arable land, organic farming is being prom oted.\nTowards this end, the Government has launched two important sche mes.\nFirst, the \u2018Parmparagat  Krishi Vikas Yojana\u2019 which will bring 5 lakh acres\nunder organic farming over a three year period.  Second, the Government has\nlaunched a value chain based organic farming scheme called \u201cOrganic Value\nChain Development in North East Region\u201d.  The emphasis is on va lue\naddition so that organic produce grown in these parts find domes tic and\nexport markets. A total provision of \u0001412 crore has been made for these\nschemes.6\n24. Incentives are being given for enhancement of pulses production .\n\u0001\u0001500 crores under National Food Security Mission has been assigned  t o\npulses.  The number of districts covered has been increased to 622.\n25. A national level competition will be held among 674 Krishi Vigyan\nKendras with a total prize money of \u000150 lakh to improve the efficiency\nand performance of theseKendras.\n26. Access to markets is critical for  the income of farmers.  The\nGovernment is implementing the Unified Agriculture Marketing Scheme\nwhich envisages a common e-market platform that will be deployed in\nselected 585 regulated wholesale markets. Amendments to the APMC Acts\nof the States are a pre-requisite to join this e-platform.  I a m happy to inform\nthat 12 States have already amended their APMC Acts and are ready to come\non board.  More States are expected to join this platform in th e coming year.\nThe Unified Agricultural Marketing E Platform will be dedicated  to the\nNation on the birthday of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14 th April this\nyear.\n27. 97 lakh MT of storage capacity was added to the Central pool stock\nduring the current year.\n28. We are implementing the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana\n(PMGSY) as never before.  This Scheme had suffered in the past because of\nunderfunding.   T h e  a l l o c a t i o n s  i n  2012-13 and 2013-14 were only \u00018,885\ncrore and \u00019,805 crore respectively. We have substantially increased the\nallocation in the last two years and have now allocated \u000119,000 crore in\n2016-17. Together with States\u2019 share, totally about \u000127,000 crore will be\nspent on this Yojana in 2016-17. Our goal is to advance the com pletion\ntarget of the programme from 2021 to 2019 and connect the remaining\n65,000 eligible habitations by constructing 2.23 lakh kms of ro ads.\nAccordingly, the pace of construction which is currently 100 km s per day, as\ncompared to the average of 73.5 kms during 2011-14, will be substantially\nstepped up.\n29. To support farmers in the aftermath of natural calamities,\nGovernment has revised the norms of assistance under the Nation al Disaster\nResponse Fund in April 2015.\n30.Special focus has been given to ensure adequate and timely flow of\ncredit to the farmers.  Against the target of \u00018.5 lakh crore in 2015-16, the\ntarget for agricultural credit in 2016-17 will be an all-time high of \u00019 lakh\ncrore. To reduce the burden of loan repayment on farmers, a provi sion of\n\u000115,000 crore has been made in the BE 2016-17 towards interest subvention.7\n31. Government has approved the path breaking Crop Insurance Scheme ,\nnamely, Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana.  For effective implementation of\nthis Scheme, I have provided a sum of \u00015,500 crore in the Budget 2016-17.\n32. We have to ensure that the benefit of MSP reaches farmers in all\nparts of the country. Three specific initiatives will be taken up in 2016-17\nfor this. First, the remaining States will be encouraged to tak e up\ndecentralized procurement.  Second, an online Procurement System will\nbe undertaken through the Food Corporation of India.  This will  usher\nin transparency and convenience to the farmers through prior\nregistration and monitoring of actual procurement. Third, effective\narrangements have been made for pulses procurement.\n33. Farmers also take up other allied activities to supplement their family\nincome. To make dairying more remunerative to the farmers, four n ew\nprojects will be taken up:  first, the \u2018 Pashudhan Sanjivani\u2019, an animal\nwellness programme and provision  o f  A n i m a l  H e a l t h  C a r d s  ( \u2018Nakul\nSwasthya Patra\u2019); second, an Advanced breed ing technology; third,\nCreation of \u2018 E-Pashudhan Haat\u2019 , an e market portal for connecting\nbreeders and farmers; and fourth, a  National Genomic Centre fo r\nindigenous breeds.  These projects will be implemented at a cos t of \u0001\u0001850\ncrores over the next few years.\n34. There has been a visible rise in the yield of honey, from an average of\n18 to 20 kg per box per annum in the year 2013-14 to 25 kg per box per\nannum by 2015-16.  The total production of honey in the country  h a s\nincreased from 76,150 metric tonnes in 2014-15 to 86,500 metric tonnes.\n90% of the domestic honey is now exported.\nII. Rural Sector\n35. After agriculture, I now turn to the other segments of the rura l\neconomy.\n36. A sum of \u00012.87 lakh crore will be given as Grant in Aid to Gram\nPanchayats and Municipalities as per the recommendations of the 14th\nFinance Commission. This is a quantum jump of 228% compared to the\nprevious five year period.   The f unds now allocated, translate to an average\nassistance of over \u000180 lakh per Gram Panchayat and over \u000121 crore per\nUrban Local Body. These enhanced allocations are capable of tra nsforming\nvillages and small towns.   M i n i s t r y  o f  P a n c h ay a t i  R a j  will work with the\nStates and evolve guidelines to actualise this.8\n37. There is an urgent need to focus on areas of drought and rural\ndistress. Every block in these distress areas will be taken up as an intensive\nBlock under the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Mission.  Formation of Self Help\nGroups (SHGs) will be speeded up to promote multiple livelihood s.  Cluster\nFacilitation Teams (CFT) will be set up under MGNREGS to ensure  water\nconservation and natural resource management.  These districts would also\nbe taken up on priority under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchaii Yojna.\n38. A sum of \u000138,500 crore has been allocated for MGNREGS in\n2016-17.\n39. 300 Rurban Clusters will be developed under the Shyama Prasad\nMukherjee Rurban Mission launched by the Honourable Prime Minis ter\nrecently. These Clusters will incubate growth centres in rural areas by\nproviding infrastructure amenities and market access for the fa rmers.  They\nwill also expand employment opportunities for the youth.\n40.As on 1 st April, 2015, a total of 18,542 villages were not electrified.\nThe Honourable Prime Minister, in his address to the Nation on 15th August,\n2015 announced that the remaining villages will be electrified within the\nnext 1000 days.\n41. As on 23rd February, 2016, 5542 villages have been electrified. This\nis more than the total combined achievement of previous three y ea r s .   T h e\nGovernment is committed to achieve 100% village electrification by\n1st May, 2018. \u0001 8,500 crore has been provided for Deendayal Upadhayaya\nGram Jyoti Yojna and Integrated Power Development Schemes.\n42. Swachh Bharat Mission is India\u2019s biggest drive to improve sanitation\nand cleanliness, especially in rural India.  This subject was very close to the\nheart of the Father of the Nation.  For the first time since in dependence, the\nParliament held a comprehensiv e debate on sanitation.  This has become a\ntopic of discussion in almost every home.  We have introduced r anking of\nurban areas in sanitation which has resulted in constructive co mpetition\namong towns and cities. \u0001 9,000 crore has been provided for Swachh Bharat\nAbhiyan.\n43. In order to continue this momentum, priority allocation from\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes will be made to reward villages tha t have\nbecome free from open defecation.\n44. We need to derive greater benefit from our demographic advantag e.\nWe need to spread digital literacy in rural India.  Of the 16.8 crore rural\nhouseholds as many as 12 crore households do not have computers and are9\nunlikely to have digitally literate persons.  We have already a pproved two\nSchemes to promote digital literacy: National Digital Literacy Mission; and\nDigital Saksharta Abhiyan (DISHA). We now plan to launch a new Digital\nLiteracy Mission Scheme for rural India to cover around 6 crore\nadditional households within the next 3 years.  Details of this scheme will\nbe spelt out separately.\n45. Modernisation of land records is critical for dispute free titl es.  The\nNational Land Record Modernisati on Programme has been revamped under\nthe Digital India Initiative and will be implemented as a Centra l sector\nscheme with effect from 1st April, 2016.  The revamped Programme will\nbuild an integrated land information management system. \u0001150 crore has\nbeen provided for this purpose.\n46. Panchayat Raj Institutions need to develop governance capabilities to\ndeliver on the Sustainable Development Goals.It is, therefore, proposed to\nlaunch a new restructured scheme, namely, Rashtriya Gram Swaraj\nAbhiyan, for which\u0001\u0001655 crore is being set apart in 2016-17.\n47. For rural development as a whole, I have allocated \u0001 87,765 crore in\nthe Budget for 2016-17.\nIII. Social Sector including Health Care\n48. When asked what he intends doing for regeneration of India, Swa mi\nVivekananda had said \u201cno amount of politics would be of any ava il until the\nmasses in India are well educated, well fed and well cared for\u201d.  I  n o w\nproceed to present the key elements of my proposals in the Social Sector.\n49. In our country, cooking gas cylinders were considered an upper\nmiddle class luxury.  Gradually it spread to the middle class.  But the poor do\nnot have access to cooking gas. Women of India have faced the curse of\nsmoke during the process of cooking.  According to experts having an open\nfire in the kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an hour. The time has come\nto remedy this situation.\n50. We have decided to embark upo n on a massive mission to\nprovide LPG connection in the name of women members of poor\nhouseholds.  I have set aside a sum of\u00012,000 crore in this year\u2019s Budget\nto meet the initial cost of providing these LPG connections. This will\nbenefit about 1 crore 50 lakh households below the poverty line  in 2016-17.\nThe Scheme will be continued for at least two more years to cov er a total of\n5 crore BPL households.  This will ensure universal coverage of  cooking gas10\nin the country.  This measure will empower women and protect th eir health.\nIt will reduce drudgery and the time spent on cooking. It will also provide\nemployment for rural youth in the supply chain of cooking gas.\n51. I want to take this opportunity to express our gratitude and\nappreciation for the 75 lakh middle class and lower middle class households\nwho have voluntarily given up their cooking gas subsidy, in response to the\ncall given by the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister.  Their gesture is a m atter of pride\nfor the country.\n52. Catastrophic health events are the single most important cause of\nunforeseen out-of-pocket expenditure which pushes lakhs of hous eholds\nbelow the poverty line every year.  Serious illness of family m embers cause\nsevere stress on the financial circumstances of poor and econom ically weak\nfamilies, shaking the foundati on of their economic security .  In order to\nhelp such families, the Government will launch a new health pro tection\nscheme which will provide health cover up to Rs.One lakh per fam ily.\nFor senior citizens of age 60 ye ars and above belonging to this  category,\nan additional top-up package up to \u0001\u000130,000 will be provided.\n53. Making quality medicines availabl e at affordable prices has been a\nkey challenge.  We will reinvigorate the supply of generic drugs . 3,000\nStores under Prime Minister\u2019s Jan Aushadhi Yojana will be opened during\n2016-17.\n54.About 2.2 lakh new patients of End Stage Renal Disease get added in\nIndia every year resulting in a dditional demand for 3.4 crore d ialysis\nsessions.  With approximately 4,950 dialysis centres in India, largely in the\nprivate sector and concentrated in the major towns, the demand is only half\nmet.  Every dialysis session costs about \u00012,000 \u2013 an annual expenditure of\nmore than \u00013 lakh.  Besides, most families ha ve to undertake frequent trip s,\noften over long distances, to access dialysis services, incurri ng heavy travel\ncosts and loss of wages.\n55. To address this situation, I pr opose to start a \u2018National Di alysis\nServices Programme\u2019.  Funds will be made available through PPP mode\nunder the National Health Mission, to provide dialysis services  in all\ndistrict hospitals.  To reduce the cost, I propose to exempt certain parts\nof dialysis equipment from basic customs duty, excise/CVD and SAD.\n56. Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tri be entrepreneurs are beginning to\nshow great promise in starting and running successful business enterprises.\nThe Prime Minister had given a call for promoting entrepreneurs hip among11\nSC/ST to become job providers rather than job seekers.  I am ha ppy to\ninform you that the Union Cabine t has approved the \u201cStand Up In dia\nScheme\u201d to promote entrepreneu rship among SC/ST and women. \u0001 500\ncrore has been provided for this purpose. The Scheme will facilitate at least\ntwo such projects per bank branch, one for each category of ent repreneur.\nThis will benefit at least 2.5 lakh entrepreneurs.\n57. We are celebrating the 125 th Birth Anniversary of Dr. B.R.\nAmbedkar. This must become the Y ear of Economic Empowerment for\nSC/ST entrepreneurs.  We have extensively interacted with the D alit India\nChamber of Commerce and Industry on building an entrepreneurshi p eco-\nsystem.  It is proposed to cons titute a National Scheduled Cast e and\nScheduled Tribe Hub in the MSME Ministry in partnership with in dustry\nassociations.  This Hub will provide professional support to Scheduled Caste\nand Scheduled Tribe entrepreneurs to fulfil the obligations under the Central\nGovernment procurement policy 2012, adopt global best practices  a n d\nleverage the Stand Up India initiative.\n58. The schemes for welfare and skill development for Minorities such as\nMulti-sectoral Development Programme and USTAAD shall be\nimplemented effectively.\nIV. Education, Skills and Job Creation\n59. I would now like to highlight the steps proposed to be taken un der\neducation, skill development and job creation which is the fourth pillar of my\nBudget proposals.\nEducation\n60. After universalisation of primary education throughout the count ry,\nwe want to take the next big step forward by focusing on the quality of\neducation. An increasing share of allocation under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan\nwill be allocated for this. Further, 62 new Navodaya Vidyalayas will be\nopened in the remaining uncovered districts over the next two years.\n61. It is our commitment to empower Higher Educational Institutions  to\nhelp them become world class teaching and research institutions. An\nenabling regulatory architecture will be provided to ten public  and ten\nprivate institutions to emerge as world-class Teaching and Rese arch\nInstitutions. This will enhance affordable access to high quality education\nfor ordinary Indians.  A detailed scheme will be formulated.\n62. We have decided to set up a Higher Education Financing Agency\n(HEFA) with an initial capital base of \u0001\u00011,000 crores. The HEFA will be a12\nnot-for-profit organisation that will leverage funds from the market and\nsupplement them with donations and CSR funds . These funds will be\nused to finance improvement in infrastructure in our top instit utions and will\nbe serviced through internal accruals.\n63. To help Students, Higher Education Institutions and Employers t o\naccess degree certificates of candidates, it is proposed to establish a Digital\nDepository for School Leaving Certificates, College Degrees, Ac ademic\nAwards and Mark sheets, on the pattern of a Securities Depository. This\nwill help validate their authenticity, safe storage and easy retrieval.\nSkill Development\n64. \u201cSkill India\u201d mission seeks to capitalise our demographic advan tage.\nSince its launch, the National Skill Development Mission has cr eated an\nelaborate skilling eco-system and imparted training to 76 lakh youth. We\nwant to bring entrepreneurship to the doorsteps of youth throughPradhan\nMantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY).  We have decided to set up 1500\nMulti Skill Training Institutes across the country. I am settin g aside an\namount of \u00011,700 crore for these initiatives.\n65. We have decided to set up a National Board for Skill Development\nCertification in partnership with the industry and academia.  We propose to\nfurther scale up Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna to skill one crore\nyouth over the next three years.\n66. Entrepreneurship Education and Training will be provided in\n2200 colleges, 300 schools, 500 Government ITIs and 50 Vocation al\nTraining Centres through Massive Open Online Courses. Aspiring\nentrepreneurs, particularly those from remote parts of the coun try, will be\nconnected to mentors and credit markets.\nJob Creation\n67. In order to incentivize creation of new jobs in the formal s ector,\nGovernment of India will pay the Employee Pension Scheme\ncontribution of 8.33% for all new employees enrolling in EPFO for the\nfirst three years of their employment . This will incentivize the employers\nto recruit unemployed persons and also to bring into the books the informal\nemployees.  In order to channelize this intervention towards the target group\nof semi-skilled and unskilled workers, the scheme will be appli cable to those\nwith salary up to \u000115,000 per month.  I have made a budget provision of\n\u00011,000 crore for this scheme.13\n68. Further, the Finance Bill, 2016 proposes to broaden and liberal ize the\nscope of the employment generation incentive available under Se ction\n80JJAA of the Income Tax Act.  The deduction will be available not only to\nassessees deriving income from manufacture of goods in a factory but to all\nassessees who are subject to statutory audit under the Act.  Thus, a deduction\nof 30% of the emoluments paid to  such employees can be claimed for three\nyears.  The minimum number of days for which they should be employed\nduring the year is proposed to be reduced from 300 to 240 days.  N o\ndeduction will, however, be admissible in respect of employees whose\nmonthly emoluments exceed \u000125,000.  Also, no deduction will be admissible\nin respect of employees for whom the Government is paying the e ntire EPS\ncontribution.\n69. A National Career Service was launched in July, 2015. Already 35\nmillion jobs seekers have registered on this platform. We propo se to make\n100 Model Career Centres operati onal by the end of 2016-17. We also\npropose to inter-link State Employment Exchanges with the National Career\nService platform.\n70. Retail Trade is the largest servi ce sector employer in the coun try.\nMany more jobs can be created in this sector, provided the regulations are\nsimplified. If Shopping Malls are kept open all seven days of the week,\nwhy not the small and medium shops?  These shops should be give n the\nchoice to remain open on all seven days of the week on voluntar y basis.\nThe interest of the workers in terms of mandatory weekly holiday, number of\nworking hours per day, etc., of course, have to be protected. We propose to\ncirculate a Model Shops and Establishments Bill which can be ad opted by\nthe State Governments on voluntary basis.\nV. Infrastructure and Investment\n71. The fifth support pillar of the Budget theme \u2018Transform India\u2019 is\ninfrastructure and investment.\n72. In the road sector, there were more than 70 projects that were\nlanguishing at the beginning of the year, due to legacy factors.  Aggregate\nlength of these projects was about 8,300 kms involving more than \u00011 lakh\ncrore investment.  With exemplary and proactive interventions, nearly 85%\nof these projects have been put back on track.\n73. India\u2019s highest ever kilometres of new highways were awarded in\n2015.  At the same time, India\u2019s highest ever production of moto r vehicles\nwas achieved in 2015.  This is a sign of growth in the economy;  but it14\npresents a challenge also.  Therefore, we have speeded up the process of road\nconstruction.  I have proposed an allocation of \u000155,000 crore in the Budget\nfor Roads and Highways. This will be further topped up by additio nal\n\u000115,000 crore to be raised by NHAI through bonds.  Thus the tota l\ninvestment in the road sector, including PMGSY allocation, woul d be\n\u000197,000 crore during 2016-17.\n74. Together with the capital exp enditure of the Railways, the t otal\noutlay on roads and railways will be \u0001\u00012,18,000 crore in 2016-17.\n75. We further expect to approve nearly 10,000 kms of National\nHighways in 2016-17. This will be much higher than in the two previous\nyears. The pace of completion of road projects will also rise t o nearly 10,000\nkms in 2016-17.  In addition, n early 50,000 kms of State highwa ys will also\nbe taken up for up-gradation as National Highways.\n76. The total outlay for infrastructure in BE 2016-17 stands at \u00012,21,246\ncrore.\n77. Passenger traffic on our roads has  to be made more efficient fo r the\nbenefit of the common man and the middle class.  This is a tota lly\nunreformed sector which suffers  from several impediments. Abolit ion of\npermit-raj will be our medium term goal. Government will enact necessary\namendments in the Motor Vehicles Act and open up the road trans port\nsector in the passenger segment.  An enabling eco-system will b e\nprovided for the States which will have the choice of adopting the new\nlegal framework .  Entrepreneurs will be able to operate buses on various\nroutes, subject to certain efficiency and safety norms. The major benefits of\nthis game changing initiative will be provision of more efficie nt public\ntransport facilities, greater public convenience, new investment  in this\nmoribund sector, creation of new jobs for our youth, growth of start-up\nentrepreneurs and other multiplier effects.  These measures will take us faster\ndown the road to development.\n78. In 2015, India\u2019s major ports have  handled the highest ever quality of\ncargo.  We have also added the highest ever capacity in major p orts.  We\nhave started a series of measures for modernizing the ports and  increasing\ntheir efficiency.  The Sagarmala project has already been rolled out.  We are\nplanning to develop new greenfield ports both in the eastern an d western\ncoasts of the country.  The work on the National Waterways is a lso being\nexpedited. \u0001800 crore has been provided for these initiatives.\n79. In the civil aviation sector, the Government is drawing up an a ction\nplan for revival of unserved and underserved airports. There ar e about 16015\nairports and air strips with Sta te Governments which can be revived at an\nindicative cost of \u000150 crore to \u0001100 crore each.  We will partner with the\nState Governments to develop some of these airports for regional\nconnectivity. Similarly, 10 of the 25 non-functional air strips  with the\nAirport Authority of India will also be developed.\n80. India is blessed with rich natural resources including oil and g as.\nHowever, their discovery and expl oitation has been below our po tential.\nImports of hydrocarbons occupy a large share of India\u2019s total imports.  There\nis a situation of rising demand, near stagnation in production and consequent\nrapid increase in imports.  As pa rt of our drive towards self-s ufficiency, the\nGovernment is considering to incentivise gas production from de ep-water,\nultra deep-water and high pressure-high temperature areas, which  a r e\npresently not exploited on account of higher cost and higher ri sks. A\nproposal is under consideration for new discoveries and areas w hich are\nyet to commence production, first, to provide calibrated market ing\nfreedom; and second, to do so at a pre-determined ceiling price  t o  b e\ndiscovered on the principle of landed price of alternative fuels.\n81. In the other segments of the infrastructure sector, our Govern ment\nhas achieved the highest coal production growth in over two decades, highest\never capacity addition in generation, highest ever increase in t ransmission\nlines and in distribution of LED bulbs.\n82. I n  t h e  p o w e r  s e c t o r ,  w e  n e e d  t o  d i v e r s i f y  t h e  s o u r c e s  o f  p o w e r\ngeneration for long term stability. Government is drawing up a\ncomprehensive plan, spanning next 15 to 20 years, to augment the\ninvestment in nuclear power generation.  Budgetary allocation u p to \u00013,000\ncrore per annum, together with public sector investments, will be leveraged\nto facilitate the required investment for this purpose.\n83. To augment infrastructure spending further, Government will per mit\nmobilisation of additional finances to the extent of \u000131,300 crore by NHAI,\nPFC, REC, IREDA, NABARD and Inland Water Authority through rais ing\nof Bonds during 2016-17.\n84. Our private sector plays an important role in the development of\ninfrastructure, many of which are implemented in the Public Private\nPartnership (PPP) mode.  I would like to announce three new initiatives to\nreinvigorate this sector.\n(i) A Public Utility (Resolution of Disputes) Bill will be\nintroduced during 2016-17 to  streamline institutional16\narrangements for resolution of disputes in infrastructure\nrelated construction contracts, PPP and public utility\ncontracts;\n(ii) Guidelines for renegotiation of PPP Concession\nAgreements will be issued, keeping in view the long term\nnature of such contracts and potential uncertainties of the\nreal economy, without compromising transparency;\n(iii) A new credit rating system for infrastructure projects\nwhich gives emphasis to various in-built credit\nenhancement structures will be developed, instead of\nrelying upon a standard perception of risk which often\nresult in mispriced loans.\n85. I would like to announce further reforms in our FDI policy .  The\nchanges proposed are in the areas of insurance and pension, Asse t\nReconstruction Companies, Stock Exchanges, etc. Details of the changes are\ngiven in Annex I of the Budget Speech.\n86. The duty drawback scheme has been widened and deepened to\ninclude more products and countries. The Government will contin ue to take\nmeasures to support the export sector.\n87. Our FDI policy has to address the requirements of farmers and f ood\nprocessing industry.  A lot of fruits and vegetables grown by our farmers\ne i t h e r  d o  n o t  f e t c h  t h e  r i g h t  p r i c e s  o r  f a i l  t o  r e a c h  t h e m a r k e ts. Food\nprocessing industry and trade should be more efficient. 100% FDI  will be\nallowed through FIPB route in ma rketing of food products produced a n d\nmanufactured in India.  This will benefit farmers, give impetus  to food\nprocessing industry and create vast employment opportunities.\n88. A new policy for management of Government investment in\nPublic Sector Enterprises, including disinvestment and strategi c sale,\nhas been approved. We have to leverage the assets of CPSEs for generation\nof resources for investment in new projects. We will encourage CPSEs to\ndivest individual assets like land, manufacturing units, etc. to release\ntheir asset value for making investment in new projects.The NITI Aayog\nwill identify the CPSEs for strategic sale.\n89. We will adopt a comprehensive app roach for efficient management\nof Government investment in CPSEs by addressing issues such as capital\nrestructuring, dividend, bonus shares, etc. The Department of\nDisinvestment is being re-named as the \u201cDepartment of Investmen t and\nPublic Asset Management (DIPAM)\u201d.17\nVI. Financial Sector Reforms\n90. A vibrant financial sector is of  critical importance to the growth of\nevery economy.    In my last two Budgets, I had announced sever al measures\nin this regard.  I would now like to announce the following initiatives:\n(i) A systemic vacuum exists with regard to bankruptcy situation s\nin financial firms. A comprehensive Code on Resolution of\nFinancial Firms will be introduced as a Bill in the Parliament\nduring 2016-17.  This Code will provide a specialised\nresolution mechanism to deal with bankruptcy situations in\nbanks, insurance companies and financial sector entities. This\nCode, together with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2015,\nwhen enacted, will provide a comprehensive resolution\nmechanism for our economy.\n(ii) The RBI Act 1934, is being amended to provide statutory basis\nfor a Monetary Policy Framework and a Monetary Policy\nCommittee through the Finance Bill 2016.  A committee-based\napproach will add lot of value and transparency to monetary\npolicy decisions.\n(iii) AFinancial Data Management Centre under the aegis of the\nFinancial Stability Development Council (FSDC) will be set up\nto facilitate integrated data aggregation and analysis in the\nfinancial sector.\n(iv) To improve greater retail participation in Government\nsecurities, RBI will facilitate their participation in the primary\nand secondary markets through stock exchanges and access to\nNDS-OM trading platform.\n(v) New derivative products will be developed by SEBI in the\nCommodity Derivatives market.\n(vi) To facilitate deepening of corporate bond market , a number\nof measures will be undertaken, details of which are given in\nAnnex II of the Budget Speech. The enactment of Insolvency\nand Bankruptcy Code would provide a major boost to the\ndevelopment of the corporate bond market.\n(vii) To tackle the problem of stressed assets in the banking sector,\nAsset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) have a very important\nrole.  I therefore, propose to make necessary amendments in\nthe SARFAESI Act 2002 to enable the sponsor of an ARC to\nhold up to 100% stake in the ARC and permit non-institutional\ninvestors to invest in Securitization Receipts.18\n(viii) In the recent past, there have been rising instances of people in\nvarious parts of the country being defrauded by illicit deposit\ntaking schemes .  The worst victims of these schemes are the\npoor and the financially illitera te.  The operation of such\nschemes are often spread over many States.  I, therefore,\npropose to bring in comprehensive Central legislation in\n2016-17 to deal with the menace of such schemes.\n(ix) I also propose toamend the SEBI Act 1992in the coming year\nto provide for more members and benches of the Securities\nAppellate Tribunal.\n91. As the Honourable Members are well aware, the strength of the\nfinancial sector is dependent upon a strong and well-functionin g Banking\nsystem. We already have a comprehensive \u2018Plan For Revamping of Public\nSector Banks\u2019, INDRADHANUSH, which is under implementation. We are\nnow confronted with the problem of stressed assets in Public Sector Banks,\nwhich is a legacy from the past.  Several steps have already been taken in\nthis regard. We are not interfering in lending and personnel mat ters of the\nBanks. Structural issues have been addressed in various sectors like Power,\nCoal, Highways, Sugar and Steel.  The Banks are putting in spec ial efforts to\neffect recoveries, with a focus on reviving stalled projects.\n92. To support the Banks in these efforts as well as to support credit\ngrowth, I have proposed an allocation of \u000125,000 crore in BE 2016-17\ntowards recapitalisation of Public Sector Banks.  If additional  capital is\nrequired by these Banks, we will find the resources for doing s o. We stand\nsolidly behind these Banks.\n93. Our Public Sector Banks will have to be strong and competitive.\nThe Bank Board Bureau will be operationalized during 2016-17 an d a\nroadmap for consolidation of Public Sector Banks will be spelt out. The\nprocess of transformation of IDBI Bank has already started. Government will\ntake it forward and also consider  the option of reducing its st ake to below\n50%.\n94. For speedier resolution of stressed assets, the Debt Recovery\nTribunals will be strengthened with focus on improving the existing\ninfrastructure, including comput erised processing of court case s, to support\nreduction in the number of hearings and faster disposal of cases.\n95. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) was launched for the\nbenefit of bottom of the pyramid entrepreneurs.  Banks and NBFC -MFIs19\nhave reported that the amount sanctioned under PMMY had reached  about\nRs.One lakh crore to over 2.5 crore borrowers by early February this year.   I\npropose to increase the target next year to \u00011,80,000 crore.\n96. To provide better access to financial services, especially in r ural\nareas, we will undertake a massive nationwide rollout of ATMs a nd Micro\nATMs in Post Offices over the next three years.\n97. Public shareholding in Government-owned companies is a means of\nensuring higher levels of transparency and accountability.  To promote this\nobjective, the general insurance companies owned by the Government will\nbe listed in the stock exchanges.\nVII. Governance and Ease of Doing Business\n98. Our Government is giving unparalleled emphasis to good governance\nwith special focus on process reforms, IT-enabled Government pr ocesses,\ne t c .     T h e  w h o l e  i d e a  i s  t o  r e m o v e  t h e  i r r i t a n t s  f o r  t h e  public in their\ninterface with Government agencies.\n99. A Task Force has been constituted for rationalisation of human\nresources in various Ministries.  A comprehensive review and ra tionalisation\nof autonomous bodies is also underway.\n100. A critical component of minimum Government and maximum\ngovernance is to ensure targeted disbursement of Government sub sidies and\nfinancial assistance to the act ual beneficiaries.  Public money  should reach\nthe poor and the deserving without any leakage.  Three specific  initiatives\nare proposed to achieve this objective.\n\uf0b7 First, we will introduce a bill for Targeted Delivery of Financial and\nOther Subsidies, Benefits and Services by using the Aadhar\nframework.  The bill will be introduced in the current Budget S ession\nof the Parliament. The Aadhar number or authentication shall not,\nhowever, confer any right of citizenship or domicile. A social\nsecurity platform will be developed using Aadhar to accurately target\nbeneficiaries. This will be a transformative piece of legislationw h i c h\nwill benefit the poor and the vulnerable.\n\uf0b7 Second, we have already introduced Direct Benefit Transfer in LPG.\nBased on this successful experience, we propose to introduce DBT on\npilot basis for fertilizer in a few districts across the countr y ,  w ith  a\nview to improving the quality of service delivery to farmers.\n\uf0b7 Third, of the 5.35 lakh Fair Price Shops in the country, automation\nfacilities will be provided in 3 lakh Fair Price Shops by March 2017.20\n101. We have to bring more transparency and efficiency in Government\nprocurement of goods and services. The Director General of Suppl ies and\nDisposal (DGS&D) will establish a technology driven platform to  facilitate\nprocurement of goods and services by various Ministries and age ncies of the\nGovernment.\n102. To remove the difficulties and impediments to ease of doing\nbusiness, we will introduce a bill to amend the Companies Act, 2013 in the\ncurrent Budget Session of the Parliament.  The Bill would also improve the\nenabling environment for start-ups.   The registration of compa nies will also\nbe done in one day.\n103. Monitoring of prices of essential commodities is a key element of\ngood governance.  A number of measures have been taken to deal with the\nproblem of abrupt increase in prices of pulses. Government has a pproved\ncreation of buffer stock of pulses through procurement at Minim um Support\nPrice and at market price through Price Stabilisation Fund. This  Fund has\nbeen provided with a corpus of \u0001900 crore to support market interventions.\n104. Madam Speaker, for good governance, we have to capitalise on the\ncountry\u2019s unity in diversity.  To strengthen understanding of e ach other, it is\nproposed to create a closer engagement between different States and Districts\nin a structured manner. \u201cEk Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\u201dprogramme will be\nlaunched to link States and Districts in an annual programme th at\nconnects people through exchanges in areas of language, trade, culture,\ntravel and tourism. We will do this through mutual agreement with\nparticipating States and Districts.\n105.In 2017, the country will celebrate 70 th Anniversary of our\nIndependence.  We will chalk out milestones for nation\u2019s journey beyond the\n70th Anniversary of Independence.  Dr. Toynbee, the historian, had o bserved\nthat \u201ca chapter which had a Western beginning will have to have an Indian\nending\u2026..\u201d.  My belief is that the year 2017 will unfold the gr eat historian\u2019s\ndream. Our scheme of \u201cEk Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\u201d is part of this vision.\nVIII. Fiscal Discipline\n106. Let me now elaborate on the fiscal situation in the context of th e\nBudget for the year 2016-17.\n107. While preparing this Budget, I have received conflicting suggestions\nabout the FRBM roadmap.  Different schools of thought have argu ed either\nin favour of fiscal consolidation and stability or for a less a ggressive21\nconsolidation and for boosting growth.   I have weighed the policy options\nand decided that prudence lies in adhering to the fiscal target s.\nConsequently, the fiscal deficit in RE 2015-16 and BE 2016-17 h ave been\nretained at 3.9% and 3.5% of GDP respectively. While doing so, I h ave\nensured that the development agenda has not been compromised.\n108. The total expenditure in the Budget for 2016-17 has been projec ted\nat \u000119.78 lakh crore,  consisting of \u00015.50 lakh crore under Plan and \u000114.28\nlakh crore under Non-Plan.   The increase in Plan expenditure is in the order\nof 15.3% over current year BE.  Plan Allocations have given spec ial\nemphasis to sectors like agriculture, irrigation, social sector including health,\nwomen and child development, welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes, minorities, infrastructure, etc. Continuing with the policy of higher\nempowering States, the total resources being transferred to States are\n\u000199,681 crore more over RE 2015-16 and\u00012,46,024 crore more over Actuals\nof 2014-15. Details of allocations in certain vital sectors and schemes and\ntransfers to States are given inAnnex III to the Speech.\n109. This is the last year of the 12 th Plan.  Successive committees have\nquestioned the merit in having Plan and Non-Plan classification of\nGovernment expenditure.  A broad understanding over the years h as been\nthat Plan expenditures are good and Non-Plan expenditures are b ad.  This\nresults in skewed allocations in the Budget.  We need to correc t this and give\ngreater focus to Revenue and Capital classification of Governme nt\nexpenditure. We have, therefore, decided that the Plan-Non-Plan\nclassification will be done away  with from fiscal 2017-18.  The  Finance\nMinistry will closely work with the State Finance Departments to align\nCentral and State Budgets in this matter.\n110. To improve the quality of Government expenditure, every new\nscheme being sanctioned by Government will have a sunset date and\noutcome review. A redeeming feature of this year\u2019s Budget is th at we\nhave improved upon the Revenue D eficit target from 2.8% to 2.5% of GDP\nin RE 2015-16.\n111. The FRBM Act has been under implementation for more than a\ndecade.  Both Central and State Governments have made significa nt gains\nfrom the implementation of this Act.  There is now a school of t hought\nwhich believes that instead of fixed numbers as fiscal deficit targets, it may\nbe better to have a fiscal deficit range as the target, which w ould give\nnecessary policy space to the Government to deal with dynamic s ituations.\nThere is also a suggestion that fiscal expansion or contraction  should be\naligned with credit contraction or expansion respectively, in t he economy.22\nWhile remaining committed to fiscal prudence and consolidation,  a time has\ncome to review the working of the FRBM Act, especially in the context of\nthe uncertainty and volatility which have become the new norms of global\neconomy. I, therefore, propose to constitute a Committee to revi ew the\nimplementation of the FRBM Act and give its recommendations on the way\nforward.\n112. As the Honourable Members are awa re, the Seventh Central Pay\nCommission has submitted its Report.  Following the past practi ce, a\nCommittee has been constituted to examine the Report and give i ts\nrecommendations. In the meantime, I have made necessary interim\nprovisions in the Budget.\n113. We have rationalised and restructured more than 1500 Central Pl an\nSchemes into about 300 Central S ector and 30 Centrally Sponsore d\nSchemes.  This will avoid overlapping of expenditure. I reitera te that I\nremain committed to the financial requirements arising from eco nomic\npackages that have been announced by our Government and also\ncommitments emanating from reorganisation of States.\n114. I have also allocated initial sums of \u0001100 crore each for celebrating\nthe Birth Centenary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay and the 350 th Birth\nAnniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.\nIX. Tax Reforms\n115. I now turn to Tax Reforms which is elaborated in Part B of my\nBudget Speech.23\nPART  B\nMadam Speaker,\n116. I shall now present my tax proposals\n117. The Government acknowledges the role of taxpayers in nation\nbuilding.  Each rupee of tax contributes towards the Government\u2019s efforts to\nprovide better infrastructure, rural revival and social well-be ing. Taxation is\na major tool available to Govern ment for removing poverty and i nequality\nfrom the society.  The posterity will not forgive us if we do n ot use this\nopportunity in this perspective.\nThe thrust of my tax proposals this year falls in nine categories:-\n(1) Relief to small tax payers.\n(2) Measures to boost growth and employment generation.\n(3) Incentivizing domestic value addition to help Make in India.\n(4) Measures for moving towards a pensioned society.\n(5) Measures for promoting affordable housing.\n(6) Additional resource mobilization for agriculture, rural economy\nand clean environment.\n(7) Reducing litigation and providing certainty in taxation.\n(8) Simplification and rationalization of taxation.\n(9) Use of Technology for creating accountability.\nRelief to small tax payers\n118. In order to lessen tax burden on individuals with income not\nexceeding \u00015 lakhs, I propose to raise the ceiling of tax rebate under sec tion\n87A from \u00012,000 to \u00015,000.  There are 2 crore tax payers in this category\nwho will get a relief of \u00013,000 in their tax liability.\n119. The people who do not have any house of their own and also do n ot\nget any house rent allowance from any employer today get a dedu ction of\n\u000124,000 per annum from their income to compensate them for the r ent they\npay.  I propose to increase the limit of deduction in respect of rent paid under\nsection 80GG from \u000124,000 per annum to \u000160,000 per annum, which should\nprovide relief to those who live in rented houses.\n120. Presumptive taxation scheme under section 44AD of the Income Ta x\nAct is available for small and medium enterprises i.e  non corp orate\nbusinesses with turnover or gross receipts not exceeding one cr ore rupees.24\nAt present about 33 lakh small bus iness people avail of this be nefit, which\nfrees them from the burden of maintaining detailed books of acc ount and\ngetting audit done.  I propose to increase the turnover limit under this scheme\nto Rupees two crores which will bring big relief to a large num ber of\nassesses in the MSME category.\n121. I also propose to extend the presumptive taxation scheme to\nprofessionals with gross receipts up to \u000150 lakh with the presumption of\nprofit being 50% of the gross receipts.\nMeasures to boost growth and employment generation\n122. I had, in my last budget speech mooted the proposal to reduce the rate\nof Corporate Tax from 30% to 25% over a period, accompanied by\nrationalization and removal of various tax exemptions and incen tives. In any\ncase the effective rate of tax paid by companies comes to an average of 24.67\n% because of various exemptions which they are availing of.   A phasing out\nplan of removing these exemptions and tax incentives was placed  in public\ndomain and we have received a large number of constructive sugge stions.\nThe final plan of phasing out exemptions is given in Annexure.  T h e\nhighlights are as follows:-\n(a) The accelerated d epreciation provided under IT Act will be\nlimited to maximum 40% from 1.4.2017.\n(b) The benefit of deductions for Research would be limited to\n150% from 1.4.2017 and 100% from 1.4.2020.\n(c) The benefit of section 10AA to new SEZ units will be availab le\nto those units which commence activity before 31.3.2020.\n(d) The weighted deduction unde r section 35CCD for skill\ndevelopment will continue up to 1.4.2020.\n123. T h e  r e d u c t i o n  i n  c o r p o r a t e  t a x  r a t e    h a s  t o  b e  c a l i b r a t e d  w i t h\nadditional revenue expected from the incentives being phased ou t. The\nbenefits from phasing out of exemptions are available to Governm ent only\ngradually.   In the first phase , therefore, I propose the follo wing two changes\nin corporate income-tax rates:-\n(a) The new manufacturing companies which are incorporated on\nor after 1.3.2016 are proposed to be given an option to be  tax ed\nat 25% + surcharge and cess provided they do not claim profit\nlinked or investment linked deductions and do not avail of\ninvestment allowance and accelerated depreciation.\n(b) I also propose to lower the corporate income tax rate for th e\nnext financial year of relatively small enterprises i.e compani es\nwith turnover not exceeding \u00015 crore (in the financial year\nending  March 2015), to 29% plus surcharge and cess.25\n124. Startups generate employment, bring innovation and are expected  to\nbe key partners in Make in India programme. I propose to assist  t h e i r\npropagation through 100% deduction of profits for 3 out of 5 ye ars for\nstartups set up during April 2016 to March 2019. MAT will apply i n such\ncases. Capital gains will not be taxed if invested in regulated/notified Fund\nof Funds and by individuals in notified startups, in which they hold majority\nshares.\n125. Research is the driver of innovation and innovation provides a thrust\nto economic growth.  I propose a special patent regime with 10%  rate of tax\non income from worldwide exploitation of patents developed and registered\nin India.\n126.In order to get more investment in Asset Reconstruction Compani es\n(ARCs) which play a very important role in resolution of bad debts, I\npropose to provide complete pass th rough of income-tax to securitization\ntrusts including trusts of ARCs. The income will be taxed in the hands of the\ninvestors instead of the trust.  However, the trust will be lia ble to deduct tax\nat source.\n127. The period for getting benefit of long term capital gain regime in case\nof unlisted companies is proposed to be reduced from three to two years.\n128. Non-banking financial companies shall be eligible for deduction  t o\nthe extent of 5% of its income in respect of provision for bad and doubtful\ndebts.\n129.The determination of residency of foreign company on the basis of\nPlace of Effective Management (POEM) is proposed to be deferred  by  one\nyear.\n130.I would like to reiterate our commitment to implement General Anti\nAvoidance Rules (GAAR) from 1.4.2017.\n131.In order to meet with our commitment to BEPS initiative of OECD\nand G-20, the Finance Bill, 2016 includes provision for require ment of\ncountry by country reporting for companies with a consolidated revenue of\nmore than Euro 750 million.\n132.I propose to exempt service tax on services provided under Deen\nDayal Upadhyay Grameen Kaushalya Yojana and services provided b y\nAssessing Bodies empanelled by Ministry of Skill Development &\nEntrepreneurship.26\n133. I propose to exempt service tax on general insurance services\nprovided under \u2018Niramaya\u2019 Health I nsurance Scheme launched by N ational\nTrust for the Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, M ental\nRetardation and Multiple Disability.\n134. To promote use of refrigerated containers, I propose to reduce the\nbasic custom and excise duty on them to 5% and 6% respectively.\n135. A number of assistive devices, rehabilitation aids and other go ods for\ndifferently abled (Divyang) persons attract Nil basic customs d uty. I propose\nto extend this exemption to Braille paper.\nIncentivising domestic value addition to help Make in India.\n136. Customs and excise duty struct ure plays an important role in\nincentivizing domestic value addition towards Make in India cam paign of\nour Government.  In line with that, I propose to make suitable c hanges in\ncustoms and excise duty rates on certain inputs, raw materials, intermediaries\nand components and certain other goods and simplify procedures,  s o  a s  t o\nreduce costs and improve compe titiveness of domestic industry i n sectors\nlike Information technology hardware, capital goods, defence pr oduction,\ntextiles, mineral fuels & mineral oils, chemicals & petrochemic als, paper,\npaperboard & newsprint, Maintena nce repair and overhauling [MRO ] of\naircrafts and ship repair etc.  Details of such changes are giv en in the\nAnnexure to Budget Speech.\nMeasures for moving towards a pensioned society\n137. Pension schemes offer financial protection to senior citizens.  I\nbelieve that the tax treatment s hould be uniform for defined be nefit and\ndefined contribution pension plans.  I propose to make withdrawal up to 40%\nof the corpus at the time of retirement tax exempt in the case of National\nPension Scheme.\n138. In case of superannuation funds and recognized provident funds,\nincluding EPF, the same norm of 40% of corpus to be tax free wi ll apply in\nrespect of corpus created out of contributions made after 1.4.2016.\n139. Further, the annuity fund which goes to the legal heir after th e death\nof pensioner will not be taxable in all three cases.   Also, we  are proposing a\nmonetary limit for contribution of employer in recognized Provi dent and\nSuperannuation Fund of \u00011.5 lakh per annum for taking tax benefit.\n140. I propose to exempt from service tax the Annuity services provi ded\nby the National Pension System ( N PS)  a n d Se r vic e s  p r o v id e d by  EPFO to\nemployees.27\n141. I also propose to reduce service tax on Single premium Annuity\n(Insurance) Policies from 3.5% to 1.4% of the premium paid in certain cases.\nMeasures for promoting affordable housing\n142. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna embodies the assurance of the\nGovernment to address the housing needs of all and more specifi cally the\npoor, in a time bound manner.  Cons truction of houses creates considerable\nemployment opportunities as well.  In order to fuel activity in the housing\nsector, I propose to give 100% deduction for profits to an unde rtaking from a\nhousing project for flats upto 30 sq. metres in four metro citi es and 60 sq.\nmetres in other cities, approve d during June 2016 to March 2019 , and is\ncompleted within three years of the approval. Minimum Alternate  Tax will,\nhowever, apply to these undertakings.\n143. For the \u2018first \u2013 home buyers\u2019, I propose to give deduction for\nadditional interest of \u000150,000 per annum for loans up to \u000135 lakh sanctioned\nduring the next financial year, provided the value of the house  does not\nexceed \u000150 lakh.\n144. Another proposal to stimulate housing activity is to facilitate\ninvestments in Real Estate Investment Trusts.  I propose that a ny distribution\nmade out of income of SPV to the REITs and INVITs having specif ied\nshareholding will not be subjected to Dividend Distribution Tax.\n145. It is proposed to exempt service tax on construction of afforda ble\nhouses up to 60 square metres unde r any scheme of the Central o r State\nGovernment including PPP Schemes.\n146.I also propose to extend excise duty exemption, presently available to\nConcrete Mix manufactured at site  for use in construction work at such site\nto Ready Mix Concrete.\nAdditional resource mobilization for agriculture, rural economy  a n d\nclean environment\n147. Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) uniformly applies to all invest ors\nirrespective of their income slabs. This is perceived to distort the fairness and\nprogressive nature of taxes. Persons with relatively higher income can bear a\nhigher tax cost. I, therefore, propose that in addition to DDT paid by the\ncompanies, tax at the rate of 10% of gross amount of  dividend will be\npayable by  the recipients, that is, individuals, HUFs and firm s receiving\ndividend in excess of \u000110 lakh per annum.28\n148. I also propose to raise the surcharge from 12% to 15% on person s,\nother than companies, firms and cooperative societies having in come above\n\u00011 crore.\n149. I also propose to collect tax at source at the rate of 1% on purchase of\nluxury cars exceeding value of Rs.ten lakh and purchase of good s and\nservices in cash exceeding Rs.two lakh. For compliant tax payer s with\nresources, this levy not only advances collection of tax when the expenditure\nis incurred, but it provides data to the tax authorities to ide ntify the persons\nwho incur such expenditure, but may be missing from the tax bas e.  Farmers\nand notified class of persons will have an option of giving a f orm by which\nTCS will not be charged.\n150. Rate of Securities Transaction tax in case of \u2018Options\u2019 is proposed to\nbe increased from .017% to .05%.\n151.In order to tap tax on income accruing to foreign e-commerce\ncompanies from India, it is proposed that a person making payment to a non-\nresident, who does not have a permanent establishment, exceeding  i n\naggregate \u00011 lakh in a year, as consideration for online advertisement, wi ll\nwithhold tax at 6% of gross amount paid, as Equalization levy. The levy will\nonly apply to B2B transactions.\n152. I propose to impose a Cess, called the Krishi Kalyan Cess, @ 0. 5%\non all taxable services, proceeds of which would be exclusively  used for\nfinancing initiatives relating to improvement of agriculture and welfare of\nfarmers. The Cess will come into force with effect from 1st June 2016.  Input\nTax credit of this cess will be available for payment of this cess.\n153. The pollution and traffic situation in Indian cities is a matte r of\nconcern.  I propose to levy an infrastructure cess, of 1% on sm all petrol,\nLPG, CNG cars, 2.5% on diesel cars of certain capacity and 4% o n other\nhigher engine capacity vehicles and SUVs.\n154. I also propose to impose an excise duty of \u20181% without input tax\ncredit or 12.5% with input tax cre dit\u2019 on articles of jewellery [excluding\nsilver jewellery, other than studded with diamonds and some oth er precious\nstones], with a higher exemption and eligibility limits of \u0001 6 crores and \u0001 12\ncrores respectively. Necessary steps will also be taken to enab l e  t h e  n e w\ntaxpayers to comply with this levy without any difficulty.\n155.I propose to change the excise duty on branded readymade garmen ts\nand made up articles of textiles with a retail sale price of \u00011,000 and above\nfrom \u2018Nil without input tax credit or 6%/12.5% with input tax c redit\u2019 to \u20182%\nwithout input tax credit or 12.5% with input tax credit\u2019.29\n156. I propose to rename the \u2018Clean Energy Cess\u2019 levied on coal, lig nite\nand peat as \u2018Clean Environment Cess\u2019 and simultaneously increas e its rate\nfrom \u0001200 per tonne to \u0001400 per tonne.\n157. To discourage consumption of tobacco and tobacco products, I\npropose to increase the excise duties on various tobacco produc ts other than\nbeedi by about 10 to 15%.\n158. I propose to amend the Finance Act, 1994 so as to declare assignment\nby the Government of the right to use the radio-frequency spect rum and its\nsubsequent transfers a service, to make it clear that assignment of right to use\nthe spectrum is a service leviable to service tax and not sale of intangible\ngoods.\nReducing litigation and providing certainty in taxation\n159. We are moving towards a lower tax regime with non-litigious\napproach.  Thus, while compliant taxpayers can expect a supportive interface\nwith the department, tax evasion will be countered strongly.  C apability of\nthe tax department to detect tax evasion has improved because o f enhanced\naccess   to information and availability of technology driven a nalytical tools\nto process such information. I want to give an opportunity to t he earlier non-\ncompliant to move to the category of compliant.\n160. I propose a limited period Compliance Window for domestic\ntaxpayers to declare undisclosed income or income represented in the form\nof any asset and clear up their past tax transgressions by payi ng tax at 30%,\nand surcharge at 7.5% and penalty at 7.5%, which is a total of 45% of the\nundisclosed income. There will be  no scrutiny or enquiry regard ing income\ndeclared in these declarations under the Income Tax Act or the Wealth Tax\nAct and the declarants will have immunity from prosecution. Imm unity from\nBenami Transaction (Prohibition) Act, 1988 is also proposed subj ect to\ncertain conditions. The surcharge levied at 7.5% of undisclosed  income will\nbe called Krishi Kalyan surcharg e  t o  b e  u s e d  f o r  a g r i c u l t u r e  a nd rural\neconomy.  We plan to open the window under this Income Disclosu re\nScheme from 1st June to 30th September, 2016 with an option to pay amount\ndue within two months of declaration.\n161. Our Government is fully committed to remove black money from th e\neconomy.  Having given one opportunity for evaded income to be declared\nonce, we would then like to focus all our resources for bringin g people with\nblack money to books.\n162.Litigation is a scourge for a tax friendly regime and creates a n\nenvironment of distrust in addition to increasing the complianc e cost of the\ntax payers and administrative cost for the Government. There are about 3\nlakh tax cases pending with the 1st Appellate Authority with disputed amount30\nbeing 5.5 lakh crores.  In order to reduce this number, I propos e  a  n e w\nDispute Resolution Scheme (DRS).\n163. A taxpayer who has an appeal pending as of today before the\nCommissioner (Appeals)   can settle his case by paying the disp uted tax and\ninterest up to the date of assessment. No penalty in respect of Income-tax\ncases with disputed tax up to \u0001 10 lakh will be levied. Cases with disputed\ntax exceeding \u0001 10 lakh will be subjected to only 25% of the minimum of the\nimposable penalty for both direct and indirect taxes.  Any pendi ng appeal\nagainst a penalty order can also be settled by paying 25% of th e minimum of\nthe imposable penalty. Certain categories of persons including those who are\ncharged with criminal offences under specific Acts are proposed to be barred\nfrom availing this scheme.\n164.I had in my Budget speech of July, 2014 assured that this\nGovernment would not retrospectively create a fresh tax liabili ty.  I had also\nhoped then that the cases pending in various courts and other l egal fora\nrelating to certain retrospectiv e amendments undertaken to the Income-tax\nAct, 1961, through the Finance Act, 2012 will soon reach their logical\nconclusion.  I would like to re iterate that we are committed to  provide a\nstable and predictable taxation regime. We will not resort to suc h\namendments in future.  I had also announced constitution of a H igh Level\nCommittee which would oversee any fresh case where the assessing officer\nproposes to assess or reassess the income in respect of indirec t transfers by\napplying the retrospective amendment.  In order to allay any fe ars of tax\nadventurism, this Committee will now be chaired by the Revenue Secretary\nand consist of Chairman, CBDT a nd an expert from outside.  This\nCommittee will effectively oversee the implementation of the assurances.\n165.In order to give an opportunity to the past cases which are ong oing\nunder the retrospective amendment, I propose a one-time scheme of Dispute\nResolution for them, in which, subject to their agreeing to wit hdraw any\npending case lying in any Court or Tribunal or any proceeding fo r\narbitration, mediation etc. unde r BIPA, they can settle the case  b y  p a y i n g\nonly the tax arrears in which case liability of the interest an d penalty shall be\nwaived.\n166.Levy of heavy penalty for concealment of income has over the years\nresulted in large number of disputes despite a number of decisi ons of the\nApex court on interpretation of statutory provisions and principles guiding\nimposition of penalty.   At present the Income-tax Officer has discretion to\nlevy penalty at the rate of 100% to 300% of tax sought to be ev aded.  I\npropose to modify the entire scheme of penalty by providing different\ncategories of misdemeanor with graded penalty and thereby subst antially\nreducing the discretionary power of the tax officers. The penal ty rates will\nnow be 50% of tax in case of unde rreporting of income and 200% of tax31\nwhere there is misreporting of facts.  Remission of penalty is also proposed\nin certain circumstances where taxes are paid and appeal is not filed.\n167. Another issue which has led to considerable number of disputes is\nquantification of disallowance of expenditure relatable to exem pt income in\nterms of Section 14A of the Income Tax Act. I propose to ration alize the\nformula in Rule 8D governing such quantification. The said Rule  is being\namended to   provide that disallowance will be limited to 1% of  the average\nmonthly value of investments yielding exempt income, but not exceeding the\nactual expenditure claimed.\n168. As another tax payer friendly measure, I propose to provide a ti me\nlimit of one year for disposing petitions of the tax payers see king waiver of\ninterest and penalty.\n169.The Income-tax Department is also issuing instruction making it\nmandatory for the assessing officer to grant stay of demand onc e the assesse\npays 15% of the disputed demand, while the appeal is pending be fore\nCommissioner of Income-tax (Appeals).  In case of deviation, as sessing\nofficer has to get orders of his superiors.  The tax payer also  has an option to\ngo to superior officer in case he does not agree with conditions of stay order\npassed by the subordinate officer.\n170.In order to remove backlog of cases we are creating 11 new benc hes\nof Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT).\n171. The monetary limit for deciding an appeal by a single member Be nch\nof ITAT is proposed to be enhanced from \u000115 lakhs to \u000150 lakhs.\n172. I also propose to amend the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, so as to\nimprove credit flow, reduce the compliance burden and associate d litigation,\nparticularly those relating to apportionment of credit between e xempted and\nnon exempted final products/servi ces. The amendments in these r ules will\nalso enable manufacturers with multiple manufacturing units to maintain a\ncommon warehouse for inputs and distribute inputs with credits to the\nindividual manufacturing units.\nSimplification and rationalization of taxation\n173. The Government has already accepted many recommendations of\nTax Administration Reform Committee and I propose to accept a n umber of\nrecommendations of Justice Easwar Committee in this Budget.\n174. To reduce multiplicity of taxes, associated cascading and to red uce\ncost of collection, I propose to abolish 13 cesses, levied by various Ministries\nin which revenue collection is less than\u000150 crore in a year.32\n175. To improve the cash flow position of small tax payers who get t heir\nfunds blocked due to current TDS provision, I propose to rationa lize TDS\nprovisions for Income Tax as per Annexure.\n176. Non-residents without PAN are currently subjected to a higher rate of\nTDS. It is proposed to amend the relevant provision to provide that on\nfurnishing of alternative documents, the higher rate will not apply.\n177. The facility for revision of return, hitherto available to a se rvice tax\nassessee only, is being extended to Central Excise assessees also.\n178. I propose to provide additional options to banking companies and\nfinancial institutions, including non-banking financial compani es, for\nreversal of input tax credits with respect to non-taxable services provided by\nthem by way of extending deposits, loans and advances.\n179. Our Government has taken a number of steps to reduce the cargo\nrelease time and the transaction costs of EXIM trade. I propose  to amend the\nCustoms Act to provide for deferred payment of customs duties for importers\nand exporters with proven track record.\n180.In 2014-15 Budget, I had announced the intent to implement Indi an\nCustoms Single Window Project. We have made significant progres s in this\nand it would be implemented at major ports and airports startin g from\nbeginning of next financial year.\n181.The customs Baggage Rules for international passengers are bein g\nsimplified so as to increase the free baggage allowance.  The f iling of\nbaggage declaration will be required only for those passengers who carry\ndutiable goods.\nUse of Technology for creating accountability\n182. Technology is a boon for mankind.  We plan to use technology in\ntaxation Department in a big way to make life simpler for a law  abiding\ncitizen, and also for data mining to track tax evaders.\n183. A pilot was run in 2015-16 for e-assessment to obviate the\nrequirement for tax payers to visit the Income-tax offices.  I propose to\nexpand the scope of e-assessments to all assessees in 7 mega cit ies in the\ncoming years. The cases selected for scrutiny will be scrutinized i n\ne-environment whereby unless the assessee himself wants to be heard, or for\nspecial reasons to be recorded, the assessing officer wants to hear the party,\nthere will be no face to face contact of IT Department with assessee.\n184. Income-tax Department (ITD) will fully expand the pilot initiative of\n\u2018e-Sahyog\u2019 with a view to reduce compliance cost, especially fo r small33\ntaxpayers.  The objective of the \u2018e-Sahyog\u2019 pilot project is to  provide an\nonline mechanism to resolve mismatches in Income-tax returns without\nrequiring taxpayers to attend the Income-tax office.\n185. I propose that in matters pertaining to Income-tax Act, Government\nwill pay interest at the rate of 9% p.a against normal rate of 6% p.a in case\nthere is delay in giving effect to Appellate order beyond ninety  d a y s .  T h e\nofficers who delay it, will be accountable for this loss to Government.\n186. I also propose to change the procedure to provide for a shift f rom\nphysical control to record based control for customs bonded war ehouses,\nsupported by sophisticated IT systems.\n187.Madam Speaker, my direct tax proposals would result in revenue loss\nof \u0001 1,060 crore and my indirect proposals are expected to yield \u000120,670\ncrores. Thus the net impact of all tax proposals would be reven ue gain of\n\u000119,610 crores.\nCONCLUSION\nMadam Speaker,\n188. This Budget is being presented amidst global and domestic\nheadwinds.  There are several challenges.  We see them as oppor tunities. I\nhave outlined the agenda of our Government to \u2018Transform India\u2019  for the\nbenefit of the farmers, the poor and the vulnerable.\n189. Madam Speaker, it is said that \u201cChampions are made from something\nthey have deep inside of them - a desire, a dream, a vision\u201d. We have a\ndesire to provide socio-economic security to every Indian, especi ally the\nfarmers, the poor and the vulnerable; we have a dream to see a mo re\nprosperous India; and a vision to \u2018Transform India\u2019.\n190. With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the\nHouse.34\nAnnex No. I to Part A\nPROPOSED CHANGES/REFORMS IN FDI AND\nRELATED POLICIES\n(i) Foreign investment will be allowed in the insurance and pens ion\nsectors in the automatic route up to 49% subject to the extant\nguidelines on Indian management and control to be verified by t he\nRegulators.\n(ii) 100% FDI in Asset Reconstr uction Companies (ARCs) will be\npermitted through automatic route.  Foreign Portfolio Investors  (FPIs)\nwill be allowed up to 100% of each tranche in securities receipts issued\nby ARCs subject to sectoral caps.\n(iii) Investment limit for foreign entities in Indian stock exchanges will be\nenhanced from 5 to 15% on par with domestic institutions. This will\nenhance global competitiveness of Indian stock exchanges and\naccelerate adoption of best-in-class technology and global market\npractices.\n(iv) The existing 24% limit for investment by FPIs in Central Public Sector\nEnterprises, other than Banks, listed in stock exchanges, will be\nincreased to 49% to obviate the need for prior approval of Gove rnment\nfor increasing the FPI investment.\n(v) The basket of eligible FDI instruments will be expanded to i nclude\nhybrid instruments subject to certain conditions.\n(vi) FDI will be allowed beyond the 18 specified NBFC activities  in the\nautomatic route in other activities which are regulated by fina ncial\nsector regulators.\n(vii) With a view to promote Make in India and following the practices in\nadvanced countries, foreign inve stors will be acc orded Residenc y\nStatus subject to certain conditions.  Currently, these investo rs are\ngranted business visa only up to 5 years at a time.\n(viii) In order to ensure effective implementation of Bilateral Investment\nTreaties signed by India with other countries, I propose to int roduce a\nCentre State Investment Agreement.  This will ensure fulfilment  of the\nobligations of the State Governments under these Treaties.  Sta tes\nwhich opt to sign these Agreements will be seen as more attract ive\ndestinations by foreign investors.\nAll these decisions will facilitate ease of doing business for foreign investors\nand their domestic recipients.35\nAnnex No. II to Part A\nMEASURES FOR DEEPENING OF CORPORATE BOND MARKET\n(a) LIC of India will set up a dedicated fund to provide credit enhancement\nto infrastructure projects.  The fund will help in raising the credit rating\nof bonds floated by infrastructure companies and facilitate inv estment\nfrom long term investors.\n(b) RBI will issue guidelines to encourage large borrowers to acc ess a\ncertain portion of their financing needs through market mechani sm\ninstead of the banks. (c) Investment basket of foreign portfoli o\ninvestors will be expanded to include unlisted debt securities and pass\nthrough securities issued by securitisation SPVs.\n(d) For developing an enabling eco system for the private placem ent\nmarket in corporate bonds, an electronic auction platform will be\nintroduced by SEBI for primary debt offer.\n(e) A complete information repository for corporate bonds, coveri ng both\nprimary and secondary market segm ents will be developed jointly  by\nRBI and SEBI.\n(f) A framework for an electronic platform for repo market in co rporate\nbonds will be developed by RBI.36\nAnnex No. III-A to Part A\nALLOCATIONS OF IMPORTANT MINISTRIES, SECTORS and\nVULNERABLE SECTIONS\nRs in crore\nMINISTRY/DEPARTMENT Actual\n14-15 RE 15-16 BE 16-17\nMinistry Of Agriculture And Farmers Welfare 25917 22958 44485\nMinistry Of Drinking Water And Sanitation 12091 10907 14010\nMinistry Of Health And Family Welfare 32154 34957 39533\nMinistry Of Housing And Urban Poverty\nAlleviation 2728 1961 5411\nMinistry Of Human Resource Development 68875 67586 72394\nMinistry Of Micro Small And Medium\nEnterprises 2767 3021 3465\nMinistry Of Minority Affairs 3089 3736 3827\nMinistry Of New And Renewable Energy 515 262 5036\nMinistry Of Road Transport And Highways 33048 47107 57976\nMinistry Of Rural Development 69817 79279 87765\nMinistry Of Skill Development And\nEntrepreneurship 0 1038 1804\nMinistry Of Social Justice And Empowerment 5784 6580 7350\nMinistry Of Urban Development 13254 18340 24523\nMinistry Of Water Resources, River\nDevelopment And Ganga Rejuvenation 5480 7032 6201\nMinistry Of Women And Child Development 18539 17352 17408\nSECTOR TOTALS Actual\n2014-15\nRE\n2015-16\nBE\n2016-17 IEBR Total for\n2016-17\nAgriculture and Irrigation 31497 25988 47912 6300 54212.33\nSocial Sectors including\nEducation and Health136431 139619 151581 \u2026 \u2026\nRural Development and\nDrinking Water81908 90185 101775 \u2026 \u2026\nInfrastructure & Energy 185139 180610 221246 25000 246246.39\nALLOCATION FOR WELFARE OF VULNERABLE SECTIONS ACROSS\nALL MINISTRIES\nActual 14-15 RE 2015-16 BE 2016-17\nSchemes for welfare of Women \u2026 81249 90625\nAllocation for welfare of Children \u2026 64635 65758\nSC sub Plan 19921 20963 24005\nST SubPlan 30035 34675 3883337\nAnnex No. III-B to Part A\nALLOCATIONS OF IMPORTANT SCHEMES\nRs.

Measures to boost the Financial Sector\n1.1 It is proposed to provide that redemption by an individual o f\nSovereign Gold Bond issued by Reserve Bank of India under\nSovereign Gold Bond Scheme, 2015 shall not be charged to capita l\ngains tax. It is also proposed to provide that long terms capital gains\narising to any person on transfer of Sovereign Gold Bond shall b e\neligible for indexation benefits.\n1.2 It is proposed to provide that any gains arising on account of\nappreciation of rupee against a foreign currency at the time of\nredemption of rupee denominated bond of an Indian company\nsubscribed by a non-resident shall be exempt from capital gains tax.\n1.3 It is proposed to provide that any transfer of units in merge ro r\nconsolidation of plans of a mutual fund scheme shall be exempt fr om\ncapital gains tax.\n1.4 It is proposed to provide that interest earned on Deposit Ce rtificates\nissued under Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 and capital gains\narising from them shall be exempt from tax.\n1.5 It is proposed to modify the conditions of special taxation regime for\noff shore funds under section 9A of the Income-tax Act so as to\nprovide that a fund registered or set up in a country notified by the\nCentral Government will also be eligible for the said regime.
