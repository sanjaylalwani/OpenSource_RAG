    "content": "5 \n \n \n17. More than 86% of our farmers are small and marginal. They are \nnot always in a position to directly transact at APMCs and other wholesale \nmarkets.  We will develop and upgrade existing 22,000 rural haats into \nGramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs). In these GrAMs, physical \ninfrastructure will be strengthened using MGNREGA and other \nGovernment Schemes. These GrAMs, electronically linked to e-NAM and \nexempted from regulations of APMCs, will provide farmers facility to make \ndirect sale to consumers and bulk purchasers.   \n18. An Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund with a corpus of `2000 crore \nwill be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing \ninfrastructure in the 22000 Grameen Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) and 585 \nAPMCs. \n19. Task of connecting all eligible habitations with an all-weather road \nhas been substantially completed, with the target date brought forward to \nMarch, 2019 from March 2022. It is now time to strengthen and widen its \nambit further to include major link routes which connect habitations to \nagricultural and rural markets (GrAMs), higher secondary schools and \nhospitals. Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana Phase III will in clude  such \nlinkages. \n20. For several years, we have been stating that India is primarily an \nagriculture based country. As India is primarily an agriculture based country, \nour districts can specialize in some or other agricultural produce and be \nknown for it. But special attention is lacking in this regard. There is a need \nto develop cluster based model in a scientific manner for identified \nagriculture produces in our districts in the same manner as we have \ndeveloped model for industrial sector.  \n21. Cultivation of horticulture crops in clusters bring advantages of \nscales\n of operations and can spur establishment of entire chain from \nproduction to marketing, besides giving recognition to the districts for \nspecific crops. The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers\u2019 Welfare will reorient \nits ongoing Schemes and promote cluster based development of agri-\ncommodities and regions in partnership with the Ministries of Food \nProcessing, Commerce and other allied Ministries. \n22. Our Government has promoted organic farming in a big way. \nOrganic farming by Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and Village \nProducers\u2019 Organizations (VPOs) in large clusters, preferably of 1000 \nhectares each, will be encouraged.  Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) will 6 \n \n \nalso be encouraged to take up organic agriculture in clusters under \nNational Rural Livelihood Programme. \n23. Our ecology supports cultivation of highly specialized medicinal and \naromatic plants. India is also home to a large number of small and cottage \nindustries that manufacture perfumes, essential oils and other associated \nproducts. Our Government shall support organized cultivation and \nassociated industry. I propose to allocate a sum of `200 crore f or  this \npurpose. \n24. Food Processing sector is growing at an average rate of 8% per \nannum.  Prime  Minister Krish i Sampada Yojana is our flagship programme \nfor boosting investment in food processing. Allocation of Ministry of Food \nProcessing is being doubled from `715 crore in  \nRE 2017-18 to `1400 crore in BE 2018-19. Government will promote \nestablishment of specialized agro-processing financial institutions in this \nsector. \n25. Tomato, onion and potato are basic vegetables consumed \nthroughout the year.  However, season al and regional production of these \nperishable commodities pose a challenge in connecting farmers and \nconsumers in a manner that satisfies both. My Government proposes to \nlaunch an \u2018\u2018Operation Greens\u2019\u2019 on the lines of \u2018\u2018Operation Flood\u2019\u2019. \n\u2018\u2018Operation Greens\u2019\u2019 shall promote Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs), \nagri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management. I propose \nto allocate a sum of `500 crore for this purpose.  \n26. India\u2019s agri-exports potential is as high as US $ 100 billion agai nst  \ncurrent exports of US $ 30 billion. To realize this potential, export of agri-\ncommodities will be liberalized. I also propose to set up state-of-the-art \ntesting facilities in all the forty two Mega Food Parks. \n27. I propose to extend the facility of Kisan Credit Cards to fisheries and \nanimal husbandry farmers to help them meet their working capital needs. \nSmall and marginal farmers will get more benefits. \n28. Bamboo is \u2018Green Gold\u2019.  We removed bamboo grown outside \nforest areas from the definition of trees.  Now, I propose to launch a Re-\nstructured National Bamboo Mission with an outlay of `1290 crore to \npromote bamboo sector in a holistic manner.  \n29. Many farmers are installing solar water pumps to irrigate their \nfields.  Generation of solar electricity is harvesting of Sun by the farmers 7 \n \n \nusing their lands. Government of India will take necessary measures and \nencourage State Governments to put in place a mechanism that their \nsurplus solar power is purchased by the distribution companies or \nlicencees at reasonably remunerative rates.  \n30. Our Government set up a Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) in \nNABARD for meeting funding requirement of irrigation works. Scope of the \nFund would be expanded to cover specified command area development \nprojects.  \n31. Last year, I had announced setting up of Micro Irrigation Fund \n(MIF) for facilitating expansion of coverage under micro irrigation and \nDairy Processing Infrastructure Development Fund (DPIDF) to help finance \ninvestment in dairying infrastructure. It is now time to expand such \nfocused investment Funds. I, now, announce setting up a Fisheries and \nAquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FAIDF) for fisheries sector \nand an Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) for \nfinancing infrastructure requirement of animal husbandry sector. Total \nCorpus of these two new Funds would be `10,000 crore. \n32. Our Government has been steadily increasing the volume of \ninstitutional credit for agriculture sector from year-to-year from `8.5 lakh \ncrore in 2014-15 to `10 lakh crore in 2017-18.  I now propose to raise this \nto `11 lakh crore for the year 2018-19.  \n33. Presently, lessee cultivators are not able to avail crop loans.  \nConsequently, a significant proportion of arable land remains fallow and \ntenant cultivators are forced to secure credit from usurious money \nlenders. NITI Aayog, in consultation with State Governments, will evolve a \nsuitable mechanism to enable access of lessee cultivators to credit without \ncompromising the rights of the land owners.  \n34. Government will extend a favourable taxation treatment to Farmer \nProducers Organisations (FPOs) for helping farmers aggregate their needs \nof inputs, farm services, processing and sale operations.  \nI shall give details in Part B of my speech. \n35. Air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region has been a cause of concern.  \nA special Scheme will be implemented to support the efforts of the \ngovernments of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the NCT of Delhi to \naddress air pollution and to subsidize machinery required for in-situ \nmanagement of crop residue. 8 \n \n \n36. Madam Speaker, the present top leadership of this country has \nreached at this level after seeing poverty at close quarters. Our leadership is \nfamiliar with the problems being faced by the SC, ST, Backward Classes and \neconomically weaker sections of the society. People belonging to poor and \nmiddle class are not case studies for them, on the other hand they \nthemselves are case study. \n37. The Lower and Middle Class have been the focus of our Government \nduring the last three years. This Government is continuously striving to \nalleviate all the small and major problems of the poor.  \n38. We launched Prime Minister\u2019s Ujjwala Scheme to make poor women \nfree from the smoke of wood. Initially our target was to provide free LPG \nconnections to about 5 crore poor women. But in view of the pace of \nimplementation of Ujjwala scheme and its popularity among the women, \nwe propose to increase the target of providing free connection to 8 crore \npoor women.  \n39. Our Government has launched Prime Minister Saubhagya Yojana for \nproviding electricity to all households of the country. Under this scheme, \nfour crores poor households are being provided with electricity connection \nfree of charge. We are spending `16000 crore under this scheme. You can \nvery well imagine our anxiety and restlessness even with one hour power \ncut. Think about those women and children whose houses will not get \nelectricity. Their life is going to change because of Pradhan Mantri \nSaubhagya Yojana.  \n40. Swachh Bharat Mission has benefited the poor. Under this mission, \nGovernment has already constructed more than 6 crore toilets. The positive \neffect of these toilets is being seen on the dignity of ladies, education of \ngirls and the overall health of family. Government is planning to construct \naround 2 crore toilets. \n41. Madam Speaker, a roof for his family is another concern of the poor. \nFar from the Benami properties earned by corruption, the poor only desire \nto have a roof, a small house by his earning of honesty. Our Govt. is helping \nthem so that they may fulfil the dream of their own house. We have fixed a \ntarget that every poor of this country may have his own house by 2022. For \nthis purpose Prime Minister Awas Yojana has been launched in rural and \nurban areas of the country. Under Prime Minister Awas Scheme Rural, 51 \nlakhs houses in year 2017-18 and 51 lakh houses during 2018-19 which is  \nmore than one crore houses will be constructed exclusively in rural areas. In \nurban areas the assistance has been sanctioned to construct 37 lakh houses. 9 \n \n \n42. My Government will also establish a dedicated Affordable Housing \nFund (AHF) in National Housing Bank, funded from priority sector lending \nshortfall and fully serviced bonds authorized by the Government of India.  \n43. Loans to Self Help Groups of women increased to about Rupees \n42,500 crore in 2016-17, growing 37% over previous year. The \nGovernment is confident that loans to SHGs will increase to `75,000 crore \nby March, 2019.  I propose to substantially increase allocation of National \nRural Livelihood Mission to `5750 crore in 2018-19. \n44. Ground water irrigation scheme under Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai \nYojna- Har Khet ko Pani will be taken up in 96 deprived irriga tion districts \nwhere less than 30% of the land holdings gets assured irrigation presently. \nI have allocated `2600 crore for this purpose. \n45. As my proposals outlined indicate, focus of the Government next \nyear will be on providing maximum livelihood opportunities in the rural \nareas by spending more on livelihood, agriculture and allied activities and \nconstruction of rural infrastructure. In the year 2018-19, for creation of \nlivelihood and infrastructure in rural areas, total amount to be spent by \nthe Ministries will be `14.34 lakh crore, including extra-budgetary and non-\nbudgetary resources of `11.98 lakh crore.  Apart from employment due to \nfarming activities and self employment, this expenditure will create \nemployment of 321 crore person days, 3.17 lakh kilometers of rural roads, \n51 lakh new rural houses, 1.88 crore toilets, and provide 1.75 crore new \nhousehold electric connections besides boosting agricultural growth. \nDetails are in Annexure I. \nHealth, Education and Social Protection  \n46. My Government\u2019s goal is to assist and provide opportunity to every \nIndian to realize her full potential capable of achieving her economic and \nsocial dreams. Our Government is implementing a comprehensive social \nsecurity and protection programme to reach every household of old, \nwidows, orphaned children, divyaang and deprived as per the Socio-\nEconomic Caste Census. Allocation on National Social Assistance \nProgramme this year has been kept at `9975 crore. \n47. We have managed to get children to School but the quality of \neducation is still a cause of serious concern. We have now defined \nlearning outcomes and National Survey of more than 20 lakh c hildren  has \nbeen conducted to assess the status on the ground.  This will help in 10 \n \n \ndevising a district-wise strategy for improving quality of education. We \nnow propose to treat education holistically without segmentation from \npre-nursery to Class 12. \n48. Improvement in quality of teachers can improve the quality of \neducation in the country. We will initiate an integrated B.Ed. programme \nfor teachers. Training of teachers during service is extremely critical.  We \nhave amended the Right to Education Act to enable more than 13 lakh \nuntrained teachers to get trained.  \n49. Technology will be the biggest driver in improving the quality of \neducation.  We  propose to increase the digital intensity in education and \nmove gradually from \u2018\u2018black board\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018digital board\u2019\u2019. Technology will also \nbe used to upgrade the skills of teachers through the recently launched \ndigital portal \u2018\u2018DIKSHA\u2019\u2019. \n50. The Government is committed to provide the best quality \neducation to the tribal children in their own environment. To realise this \nmission, it has been decided that by the year 2022, every block with more \nthan 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an \nEkalavya Model Residential School. Ekalavya schools will be on par with \nNavodaya Vidyalayas and will have special facilities for preserving local art \nand culture besides providing training in sports and skill development. \n51. To step up investments in research and related infrastructure in \npremier educational institutions, including health institutions, I propose to \nlaunch a major initiative named \u2018\u2018Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in \nEducation (RISE) by 2022\u2019\u2019 with a total investment of `1,00,000 crore in \nnext four years. Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) would be \nsuitably structured for funding this initiative. \n52. Our Government has taken major initiative of setting up Institutes \nof Eminence. There has been tremendous response to this initiative by \ninstitutions both in public and private sectors. We have received more \nthan 100 applications.  We have also taken steps to set up a specialized \nRailways University at Vadodara.   \n53. We propose to set up two new full-fledged Schools of Planning and \nArchitecture, to be selected on challenge mode. Additionally, 18 new SPAs \nwould be established in the IITs and NITs as autonomous Schools, also on \nchallenge mode. \n54. The Government would launch the \u2018\u2018Prime Minister\u2019s Research \nFellows (PMRF)\u2019\u2019 Scheme this year. Under this, we would identify 1,000 11 \n \n \nbest B.Tech students each year from premier institutions and provide \nthem facilities to do Ph.D in IITs and IISc, with a handsome fellowship. It is \nexpected that these bright young fellows would voluntarily commit few \nhours every week for teaching in higher educational institutions. \n55. Now I come to the Health Sector. \u00ba\u00c9\u00b4\u00c9\u00e4\u00c7 \u00a3\u00c9\u00b4\u00c9xi\u00c9\u00d6: \n\u00ba\u00c9\u00d6\u00c9\u00caJ\u00c9 x\u00c9, \u00ba\u00c9\u00b4\u00c9\u00e4\u00c7 \u00ba\u00c9\u00c6i\u00c9\u00d6: \u00c9\u00cax\u00c9\u00ae\u00c9\u00e0\u00c9\u00aa\u00c9\u00c9  is the guiding \nprinciple of my Government. Only Swasth Bharat can be a Samriddha \nBharat.  India cannot realize its demographic dividend without its citizens \nbeing healthy.  \n56. I am pleased to announce two major initiatives as part of \n\u2018\u2018\nAyushman Bharat \u2019\u2019 programme aimed at making path breaking \ninterventions to address health holistically, in primary, secondary and \ntertiary care system covering both prevention and health promotion.   \n57. The National Health Policy, 2017 has envisioned Health and \nWellness Centres as the foundation of India\u2019s health system.\n These 1.5 \nlakh centres will bring health care system closer to the homes of people. \nThese centres will provide comprehensive health care, including for non-\ncommunicable diseases and maternal and child health services.  These \ncentres will also provide free essential drugs and diagnostic services.  \nI am committing `1200 crore in this budget for this flagship programme.  I \nalso invite contribution of private sector through CSR and philanthropic \ninstitutions in adopting these centres. \n58. Madam Speaker, we are all aware that lakhs of families in our \ncountry have to borrow or sell assets to receive indoor treatment in \nhospitals. Government is seriously concerned about such impoverishment \nof poor and vulnerable families. Present Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana \n(RSBY) provide annual coverage of only `30,000 to poor families. Several \nState Governments have also implemented/supplemented health \nprotection schemes providing varying coverage.  My Government has now \ndecided to take health protection to more aspirational level. \n59. We will launch a flagship National Health Protection Scheme to \ncover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore \nbeneficiaries) providing coverage upto 5 lakh rupees per family per year \nfor secondary and tertiary care hospitalization.  This will be the world\u2019s \nlargest government funded health care programme. Adequate funds will \nbe provided for smooth implementation of this programme.  12 \n \n \n60. Madam Speaker, these two far-reaching initiatives under the \nAyushman Bharat will build a New India 2022 and ensure enhanced \nproductivity, well being and avert wage loss and impoverishment. These \nSchemes will also generate lakhs of jobs, particularly for women. The \nGovernment is steadily but surely progressing towards the goal of Universal \nHealth Coverage.  \n61. TB claims more lives every year than any other infectious disease.  \nIt affects mainly poor and malnourished people.  My Government has, \ntherefore, decided to allocate additional `600 crore to provide nutritional \nsupport to all TB patients\n at the rate of `500 per month for the duration of \ntheir treatment. \n62. In order to further enhance accessibility of quality medical \neducation and health care, we will be setting up 24 new Government \nMedical Colleges and Hospitals by upgrading existing district hospitals in \nthe country. This would ensure that there is at least 1 Medical College for \nevery 3 Parliamentary Constituencies and at least 1 Government Medical \nCollege in each State of the country.  \n63. Our resolve of making our villages open defecation free is aimed at \nimproving the life of our villagers.  We will launch a Scheme called \nGalvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBAR-DHAN) for \nmanagement and conversion of cattle dung and solid waste in farms to \ncompost, fertilizer, bio-gas and bio-CNG. \n64. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Beema Yojana (PMJJBY) has benefitted \n5.22 crore families with a life insurance cover of `2 lakh on payment of a \npremium of only `330/- per annum. Likewise, under Pradhan Mantri \nSuraksha Bima Yojana, 13 crore 25  lakh p ersons  have been insured with \npersonal accident cover of `2 lakh on payment of a premium of only `12 \nper annum.  The Government will work to cover all poor households, \nincluding SC/ST households, under these in a mission mode.  \n65. The Government will expand the coverage under Prime Minister \nJan Dhan Yojana by bringing all sixty crore basic accounts within its fold \nand undertake measures to provide services of micro insurance and \nunorganized sector pension schemes through these accounts.  \n66. Our commitment towards \u2018\u2018Beti Bachao Beti Padhao\u2019\u2019 is unflinching. \nSukanya Samriddhi Account Scheme launched in January 2015 has been a \ngreat success. Until November, 2017 more than 1.26 crore accounts have 13 \n \n \nbeen opened across the country in the name of girl-child securing an \namount of `19,183 crore.   \n67. Cleaning the Ganga is work of national importance and it is our \nfirm commitment.  Members will be happy to learn that this work has \ngathered speed.  A  total of 187 projects have been sanctioned under the \nNamami Gange programme for infrastructure development, river surface \ncleaning, rural sanitation and other interventions at a cost of  \n`16,713 crore.  47 projects have been completed and remaining projects \nare at various stages of execution.   All 4465 Ganga Grams \u2013 villages on \nthe bank of river - have been declared open defecation free. \n68. To give focused attention and to achieve our vision of an inclusive \nsociety, the Government has identified 115 aspirational d istricts taking \nvarious indices of development in consideration.  The Government aims at \nimp\nroving the quality of life in these districts by investing in social services \nlike health, education, nutrition, skill upgradation, financial inclusion and \ninfrastructure like irrigation, rural electrification, potable drinking water \nand access to toilets at an accelerated pace and in a time bound manner. \nWe expect these 115 districts to become model of development. \n69. Economic and social advancement of hard working people of \nScheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) has received core \nattention of Government. Our Government increased total earmarked \nallocation for SCs in 279 programmes from `34,334 crore in 2016-17 to \n`52,719 crore in RE 2017-18.  Likewise,  for STs, earmarked allocation was \nincreased from `21,811 crore in 2016-17 to `32,508 crore in  \nRE 2017-18 in 305 programmes. I propose an earmarked allocation of \n`56,619 crore for SCs and `39,135 crore for STs in BE 2018-19. \n70. Government\u2019s estimated schematic budgetary expenditure on \nhealth, education and social protection for 2018-19 is `1.3 8  lakh crore \nagainst estimated expenditure of `1.22 lakh crore in BE 2017-18. Details \nare in Annexure II. This expenditure is likely to go up by at least `15,000 \ncrore in 2018-19 on account of additional allocation during the year and \nextra budgetary expenditure, including through Higher Education Financing \nAgency.  \nMedium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) and \nEmployment  14 \n \n \n71. Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) are a major engine \nof growth and employment in the country.  I have provided  \n`3794 crore to MSME Sector for giving credit support, capital and interest \nsubsidy and innovations. Massive formalization of the businesses of \nMSMEs is taking place in the country after demonetization and \nintroduction of GST.  This is generating enormous financial information \ndatabase of MSMEs\u2019 businesses and finances.  This big data base will be \nused for improving financing of MSMEs\u2019 capital requirement, including \nworking capital.  \n72. It is proposed to onboard public sector banks and corporates on \nTrade Electronic Receivable Discounting System (TReDS) platform and link \nthis with GSTN. Online loan sanctioning facility for MSMEs will be \nrevamped for prompt decision making by the banks.  Government will \nsoon announce measures for effectively addressing non-performing assets \nand stressed accounts of MSMEs. This will enable larger financing of \nMSMEs and also considerably ease cash flow challenges faced by them. In \norder to reduce tax burden on MSMEs and to create larger number of \njobs, I will be announcing some tax measures in Part B of my speech. \n73. MUDRA Yojana launched in April, 2015 has led to sanction of `4.6 \nlakh crore in credit from 10.38 crore MUDRA loans. 76% of loan accounts \nare of women and more than 50% belong to SCs, STs and OBCs.  It is \nproposed to set a target of `3 lakh crore for lending under MUDRA for \n2018-19 after h aving  successfully exceeded the targets in all previous \nyears.      \n74. Non-Bank Finance Companies (NBFCs) stepped up financing of \nMSMEs after demonetization.  NBFCs can be very powerful vehicle for \ndelivering loans under MUDRA.  Refinancing policy and eligibility criteria \nset by MUDRA will be reviewed for better refinancing of NBFCs. \n75. Use of Fintech in financing space will help growth of MSMEs. A \ngroup in the Ministry of Finance is examining the policy and institutional \ndevelopment measures needed for creating right environment for Fintech \ncompanies to grow in India. \n76. Venture Capital Funds and the angel investors need an innovative \nand special developmental and regulatory regime for their growth.  We \nhave taken a number of policy measures including launching \u2018\u2018Start-Up \nIndia\u2019\u2019 program, building very robust alternative investment regime in the \ncountry and rolling out a taxation regime designed for the special nature \nof the VCFs and the angel investors. We will take additional measures to 15 \n \n \nstrengthen the environment for their growth and successful operation of \nalternative investment funds in India. \n77. Creating job opportunities and facilitating generation of \nemployment has been at the core of our policy-making. During the last \nthree years, we have taken a number of steps to boost employment \ngeneration in the country. These measures include:- \n\uf0b7 Contribution of 8.33% of Employee Provident Fund (EPF) for \nnew employees by the Government for three years.  \n\uf0b7 Contribution of 12% to EPF for new employees for three \nyears by the Government in sectors employing large \nnumber of people like textile, leather and footwear. \n\uf0b7 Additional deduction to the employees of 30% of the wages \npaid for new employees under the Income Tax Act.  \n\uf0b7 Launch of National Apprenticeship Scheme with stipend \nsupport and sharing of the cost of basic training by the \nGovernment to give training to 50 lakh youth by 2020. \n\uf0b7 Introducing system of fixed term employment for apparel \nand footwear sector. \n\uf0b7 Increasing paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, \nalong with provision of cr\u00e8ches. \n78. These measures have started showing results. An independent \nstudy conducted recently has shown that 70 lakh formal jobs will be \ncreated this year.  \n79. To carry forward this momentum, I am happy to announce that the \nGovernment will contribute 12% of the wages of the new employees in \nthe EPF for all the sectors for next three years.  Also,  the f acility  of fixed \nterm employment will be extended to all sectors.  \n80. To incentivize employment of more women in the formal sector \nand to enable higher take-home wages, I propose to make amendments in \nthe Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 to \nreduce women employees' contribution to 8% for first three years of their \nemployment against existing rate of 12% or 10% with no change in \nemployers' contribution. 16 \n \n \n81. The Government is setting up a model aspirational skill centre in \nevery district of the country under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra \nProgramme.  306 Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra have been established \nfor imparting skill training through such centers. \n82. The Government had approved a comprehensive textile sector \npackage of `6000 crore in 2016 to boost the apparel and made-up \nsegments. I, now propose to provide an outlay of `7148 crore for the \ntextile sector in 2018-19.  \n \nInfrastructure and Financial Sector Development \n83. Infrastructure is the growth driver of economy.  Our country needs \nmassive investments estimated to be in excess of `50 lakh crore in \ninfrastructure to increase growth of GDP, connect and integrate the nation \nwith a network of roads, airports, railways, ports and inland waterways \nand to provide good quality services to our people.  \n84. We have made an all-time high allocation to rail and road sectors. \nWe are committed to further enhance public investment. Provision of key \nlinkages like coal for power, power for railways and railway rakes for coal \nhave been rationalized and made very efficient.  Prime Minister personally \nreviews the targets and achievements in infrastructure sectors on a \nregular basis.  Using  online monitoring system of PRAGATI alone, projects \nworth 9.46 lakh crore have been facilitated and fast tracked.  \n85. To secure India\u2019s defences, we are developing connectivity \ninfrastructure in border areas. Rohtang tunnel has been completed to \nprovide all weather connectivity to the Ladakh region.  Contract for \nconstruction of Zozila Pass tunnel of more than 14 kilometer is progressing \nwell. I now propose to take up construction of tunnel under Sela Pass. For \npromoting tourism and emergency medical care, Government will make \nnecessary framework for encouraging investment in sea plane activities.  \n86. Urbanization is our opportunity and priority.  My  Government h as \nrolled out two interlinked programmes \u2013 Smart Cities Mission and the \nAMRUT.   \n87. Smart Cities Mission aims at building 100 Smart C ities  with state-of-\nthe-art amenities. I am happy to inform that 99 Cities have been selected \nwith an outlay of `2.04 lakh crore. These Cities have started implementing \nvarious projects like Smart Command and Control Centre, Smart Roads, 17 \n \n \nSolar Rooftops, Intelligent Transport Systems, Smart Parks. Projects worth \n`2350 crore have been completed and works of `20,852 crore are under \nprogress. To preserve and revitalize soul of the heritage cities in India, \nNational Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) \nhas been taken up in a major way. \n88. India is blessed with an abundance of tourist attractions. It is \nproposed to develop ten prominent tourist sites into Iconic Tourism \ndestinations by following a holistic approach involving infrastructure and \nskill development, development of technology, attracting private \ninvestment, branding and marketing.  In addition, tourist amenities at 100 \nAdarsh monuments of the Archaeological Survey of India will be upgraded \nto enhance visitor experience. \n89. The AMRUT programme focuses on providing water supply to all \nhouseholds in 500 cities. State level plans of `77,640 crore for 500 cities \nhave been approved. Water supply contracts for 494 projects worth \n`19,428 crore and sewerage work contract for 272 projects costing `12,429 \ncrore has been awarded.  \n90. Reforms are being catalyzed by these missions. 482 cities h ave  \nstarted credit rating.  144 cities have got investment grade rating. \n91. My Ministry will leverage the India Infrastructure Finance \nCorporation Limited (IIFCL) to help finance major infrastructure projects, \nincluding investments in educational and health infrastructure, on strategic \nand larger societal benefit considerations.  \n92. Our Government has scaled new heights in development of Road \nInfrastructure sector. We are confident to complete National Highways \nexceeding 9000 kilometers length during 2017-18.  Ambitious Bharatmala \nPariyojana has been approved for providing seamless connectivity of \ninterior and backward areas and borders of the country to develop about \n35000 kms in Phase-I at an estimated cost of `5,35,000 crore. To raise \neq\nuity from the market for its mature road assets, NHAI will consider \norganizing its road assets into Special Purpose Vehicles and use innovative \nmonetizing structures like Toll, Operate and Transfer (TOT) and \nInfrastructure Investment Funds (InvITs).  \n93. Strengthening the railway network and enhancing Railways\u2019 \ncarrying capacity has been a major focus of the Government. Railways\u2019 \nCapex for the year 2018-19 has b een  pegged at `1,48,528 crore.  A large \np\nart of the Capex is devoted to capacity creation.  18,000 kilometers of 18 \n \n \ndoubling, third and fourth line works and 5000 kilometers of gauge \nconversion would eliminate capacity constraints and transform almost \nentire network into Broad Gauge.  \n94. There has also been significant improvement in the achievement of \nphysical targets by Railways as well. We are moving fast towards optimal \nelectrification of railway network.  4000 kilometers are targeted for \ncommissioning during 2017-18.   \n95. Work on Eastern and Western dedicated Freight Corridors is in full \nswing.  Adequate number of rolling stock \u2013 12000 wagons, 5160 coaches \nand approximately 700 locomotives are being procured during 2018-19.  A \nmajor programme has been initiated to strengthen infrastructure at the \nGoods sheds and fast track commissioning of private sidings.   \n96. A \u2018Safety First\u2019 policy, with allocation of adequate funds under \nRashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh is cornerstone of Railways\u2019 focus on safety. \nMaintenance of track infrastructure is being given special attention. Over \n3600 kms of track renewal is targeted during the current fiscal.  Other \nmajor steps include increasing use of technology like \u2018\u2018Fog Safe\u2019\u2019 and \n\u2018\u2018Train Protection and Warning System\u2019\u2019. A decision has been taken to \neliminate 4267 unmanned level crossings in the broad gauge network in \nthe next two years.  \n97. Redevelopment of 600 major railway stations is being taken up by \nIndian Railway Station Development Co. Ltd.  All stations with more than \n25000 footfalls will have escalators.  All railway stations and trains will be \nprogressively provided with wi-fi.  CCTVs will be provided at all stations \nand on trains to enhance security of passengers. Modern train-sets with \nstate-of-the-art amenities and features are being designed at Integrated \nCoach Factory, Perambur. First such train-set will be commissioned during \n2018-19. \n98. Mumbai\u2019s transport system, the lifeline of the City, is being \nexpanded and augmented to add 90 kilometers of d ouble line tracks at a \ncost of over `11,000 crore. 150 kilometers of additional suburban network \nis being planned at a cost of over `40,000 crore, including elevated \ncorridors on some sections. A suburban network of approximately 160 \nkilometers at an estimated cost of `17,000 crore is being planned to cater \nto the growth of the Bengaluru metropolis.   \n99. Foundation for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, India\u2019s \nfirst high speed rail project was laid on September 14, 2017. An Institute is 19 \n \n \ncoming up at Vadodara to train manpower required for high speed rail \nprojects.  \n100. In the last three years, the domestic air passenger traffic grew at \n18% per annum and our airline companies placed orders for more than \n900 aircrafts.  Regional connectivity scheme of UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam \nNagrik) initiated by the Government last year shall connect 56 unserved \nairp\norts and 31 unserved helipads across the country. Operations have \nalready started at 16 such airports. \u00ba\u00c9\u00aeB\u00c9E\u00c9\u00ae B\u00c9E\u00c9\u00d2 <\u00ba\u00c9 {\u00c9c\u00e3\u00c9 \n\u00ba\u00c9\u00e4 c\u00b4\u00c9\u00c9<\u00c7 S\u00c9{{\u00c9\u00e3\u00c9 {\u00c9cx\u00c9x\u00c9\u00e4 \u00b4\u00c9\u00c9\u00e3\u00c9\u00e4 x\u00c9\u00c9M\u00c9\u00c9\u00ca\u00aeB\u00c9E \n\u00a3\u00c9\u00c9\u00d2 c\u00b4\u00c9\u00c9<\u00c7 V\u00c9c\u00c9V\u00c9 \u00e0\u00c9\u00e4 \u00aa\u00c9\u00c9j\u00c9\u00c9 B\u00c9E\u00ae \u00aec\u00e4 c\u00e9* Airport \nAuthority of India (AAI) has 124 airports. We propose to expand our \nairport capacity more than five times to handle a billion trips a year under \na new initiative - NABH Nirman. Balance sheet of AAI shall be leveraged to \nraise more resources for funding this expansion. \n101. Our efforts to set up a Coalition on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure \nfor developing international good practices, appropriate standards and \nregulatory mechanism for resilient infrastructure development are moving \nwell.  I propose to allocate `60 crores to kick start this initiative in 2018-19. \n102. The Government and market regulators have taken necessary \nmeasures for development of monetizing vehicles like Infrastructure \nInvestment Trust (InvIT) and Real Investment Trust (ReITs) in India. The \nGovernment would initiate monetizing select CPSE assets using InvITs from \nnext year. \n103. In the current year, we included, in the scope of harmonized list of \ninfrastructure, ropeways to promote tourism, logistics parks and expanded \nthe scope of railways infrastructure to include development of commercial \nland around railway stations.   \n104. Reserve Bank of India has issued guidelines to nudge Corporates \naccess bond market. SEBI will also consider mandating, beginning with \nlarge Corporates, to meet about one-fourth of their financing needs from \nthe bond market.  \n105. Corporate bonds rated \u2018BBB\u2019 or equivalent are investment grade. In \nIndia, most regulators permit bonds with the \u2018AA\u2019 rating only as eligible for \ninvestment.  It is now time to move from \u2018AA\u2019 to \u2018A\u2019 grade ratings.  The \ngovernment and concerned regulators will take necessary action. 20 \n \n \n106. We will take reform measures with respect to stamp duty regime \non financial securities transactions in consultation with the States and \nmake necessary amendments the Indian Stamp Act.  \n107. International Financial Service Centre (IFSC) at Gift City, which has \nbecome operational, needs a coherent and integrated regulatory \nframework to fully develop and to compete with other offshore financial \ncentres. The Government will establish a unified authority for regulating \nall financial services in IFSCs in India. \n108. Global economy is transforming into a digital economy thanks to \ndevelopment of cutting edge technologies in digital space \u2013 machine \nlearning, artificial intelligence, internet of things, 3D printing and the like. \nInitiatives such as Digital India, Start Up India, Make in India would help \nIndia establish itself as a knowledge and digital society. NITI Aayog will \ninitiate a national program to direct our efforts in the area of artificial \nintelligence, including research and development of its applications.   \n109. Combining cyber and physical systems have great potential to \ntransform not only innovation ecosystem but also our economies and the \nway we live. To invest in research, training and skilling in robotics, artificial \nintelligence, digital manufacturing, big data analysis, quantum \ncommunication and internet of things, Department of Science & \nTechnology will launch a Mission on Cyber Physical Systems to support \nestablishment of centres of excellence. I have doubled the allocation on \nDigital India programme to ` 3073 crore in 2018-19. \n110. Task of connecting one lakh gram panchayat through high speed \noptical fiber network has been completed under phase I of the Bharatnet \nproject. This has enabled broadband access to over 20 crore ru ral  Indians \nin about two lakh fifty thousand villages. The Government also proposes \nto setup five lakh wi-fi hotspots which will provide broadband access to \nfive crore rural citizens. I have provided `10000 crore in 2018-19 for \ncreation and augmentation of Telecom infrastructure.  \n111. To harness the benefit of emerging new technologies, particularly \nthe \u2018Fifth Generation\u2019 (5G) technologies and its adoption, the Department \nof Telecom will support establishment of an indigenous 5G Test Bed at IIT, \nChennai. \n112. Distributed ledger system or the block chain technology allows \norganization of any chain of records or transactions without the need of \nintermediaries. The Government does not consider crypto-currencies legal \ntender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-\nassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. 21 \n \n \nThe Government will explore use of block chain technology proactively for \nushering in digital economy. \n113. The system of toll payments physically by cash at road toll plazas is \nbeing fast replaced with Fastags and other electronic payment systems to \nmake road travel seamless. Number of Fastags has gone up from about \n60,000 in December, 2016 to more than 10 lakh n ow. From December, \n2017 all class \u2018\u2018M\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018N\u2019\u2019 vehicles are being sold only with the Fastags. \nThe Government will come out with a policy to introduce toll system on \n\u2018\u2018pay as you use\u2019\u2019 basis.   \n114. In order to create employment and aid growth, Government\u2019s \nestimated budgetary and extra budgetary expenditure on infrastructure \nfor 2018-19 is being increased to `5.97 lakh crore against estimated \nexpenditure of `4.94 lakh crore in 2017-18. Details are in Annexure III. \nBuilding Institutions and Improving Public Service Delivery \n115. Our armed forces have played a stellar role in meeting the \nchallenges we have been facing on our borders as well as in managing the \ninternal security environment both in Jammu and Kashmir and the North \nEast.  I  would like to place on record our appreciation for the efforts and \nthe sacrifices made by the three services in defending the interests of the \nNation.   \n116. Ever since the NDA Government has assumed office in 2014, lot of \nemphasis has been given to modernizing and enhancing the operational \ncapability of the Defence Forces.  A number of initiatives have been taken \nto develop and nurture intrinsic defence production capability to make the \nNation self-reliant for meeting our defence needs. Ensuring adequate \nbudgetary support will be our priority.  \n117. We have opened up private investment in defence production \nincluding liberalizing foreign direct investment.  We will take measures to \ndevelop two defence industrial production corridors in the country. The \nGovernment will also bring out an industry friendly Defence Production \nPolicy 2018 to promote domestic production by public sector, private \nsector and MSMEs. \n118. Aadhar has provided an identity to every Indian.  Aadhar has eased \ndelivery of so many public services to our people.  Every enterprise, major \nor small, also needs a unique ID.  The Government will evolve a Scheme to \nassign every individual enterprise in India a  \nunique ID. 22 \n \n \n119. To carry the business reforms for ease of doing business deeper \nand in every State of India, the Government of India has identified 372 \nspecific business reform actions.  All States have taken up these reforms \nand simplifications in a mission mode constructively competing with each \nother.  Evaluation of performance under this Programme will now be \nbased on user feedback. \n120. Capital of the Food Corporation of India will be restructured to \nenhance equity and to raise long-term debt for meeting its standing \nworking capital requirement.   \n121. Budgeting of Government of India\u2019s contribution in equity and debt \nof the metro ventures floated by the State Governments will be \nstreamlined.  \n122. Department of Commerce will be developing a National Logistics \nPortal as a single window online market place to link all stakeholders. \n123. The Government has approved listing of 14 CPSEs, including two \ninsurance companies, on the stock exchanges. The Government has also \ninitiated the process of strategic disinvestment in 24 CPSEs. T his  includes \nstrategic privatization of Air India.   \n124. Process of acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation by the \nONGC has been successfully completed. Three public sector general \ninsurance companies National Insurance Company Ltd., United India \nAssurance Company Limited and Oriental India Insurance Company Limited \nwill be merged into a single insurance entity and will be subsequently \nlisted. \n125. The Government introduced Exchange Traded Fund Bharat-22 to \nraise `14,500 crore, which was over-subscribed in all segments. DIPAM will \ncome up with more ETF offers including debt ETF. \n126. 2017-18 Budget Estimates for disinvestment were pegged at the \nhighest ever level of `72,500 crore.  I am happy to inform the House that \nwe have already exceeded the budget estimates. I am assuming receipts of \n`1,00,000 crore in 2017-18. I am setting the disinvestment target of \n`80,000 crore for 2018-19. \n127. Bank recapitalization program has been launched with bonds of \n`80,000 crore being issued this year.  The programme has been integrated \nwith an ambitious reform agenda, under the rubric of an Enhanced Access \nand Service Excellence (EASE) programme. This recapitalization will pave 23 \n \n \nthe way for the public sector banks to lend additional credit of `5 lakh \ncrore. \n128. It is proposed to allow strong Regional Rural Banks to raise capital \nfrom the market to enable them increase their credit to rural economy. \n129. National Housing Bank Act is being amended to transfer its equity \nfrom the Reserve Bank of India to the Government. Indian Post Offices \nAct, Provident Fund Act and National Saving Certificate Act are being \namalgamated and certain additional people friendly measures are being \nintroduced. To provide t he  Reserve Bank of India an instrument to manage \nexcess liquidity, Reserve Bank of India Act is being amended to \ninstitutionalize an Uncollateralized Deposit Facility. Securities and \nExchange Board of India, Act 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act \n1956, and Depositories Act 1996, are being amended to streamline \nadjudication procedures and to provide for penalties for certain \ninfractions. These proposals are in the Finance Bill. \n130. For easier access, links to all Detailed Demand for Grants will be \nprovided at india.gov.in. The Government will also consider feasibility of \nproviding disclosed fiscal information in a machine readable form.   \n131. The Government is transforming method of disposal of its business \nby introduction of e-office and other e-governance initiatives in central \nMinistries and Departments.  These initiatives are listed in Annexure IV. \n132. The Government will formulate a comprehensive Gold Policy to \ndevelop gold as an asset class.  The Government will also establish a \nsystem of consumer friendly and trade efficient system of regulated gold \nexchanges in the country. Gold Monetization Scheme will be revamped to \nenable people to open a hassle-free Gold Deposit Account.   \n133. Outward Direct Investment (ODI) from India has grown to US$15 \nbillion per annum. The Government will review existing guidelines and \nprocesses and bring out a coherent and integrated Outward Direct \nInvestment (ODI) policy.  \n134. Hybrid instruments are suitable for attracting foreign investments \nin several niche areas, especially for the startups and venture capital firms. \nThe Government will evolve a separate policy for the hybrid instruments. \n135. The emoluments of the President, the Vice President and the \nGovernors were last revised with effect from 1st January, 2006.  These \nemoluments are proposed to be revised to `5 lakh for the President,  \n`4 lakhs for the Vice President and to `3.5 lakh per month for the \nGovernors.   24 \n \n \n136. There has been a public debate with regard to the emoluments \npaid to the Members of Parliament.  Present practice allows the recipients \nto fix their own emoluments which invites criticism. I am, therefore, \nproposing necessary changes to refix the salary, constituency allowance, \noffice expenses and meeting allowance payable to Members of Parliament \nwith effect from April 1, 2018.  The law will also provide for automatic \nrevision of emoluments every five years indexed to inflation. I am sure \nH\non\u2019ble Members will welcome this initiative and will not suffer such \ncriticism in future. \n137. Our country will commemorate 150th birth anniversary of \nMahatma Gandhi, Father of the Nation, from 2nd October, 2019 to 2nd \nOctober 2020.  The Government and the People of India will rededicate \nthem, through their actions, to the ideals that the Mahatma taught and \nlived by.  A National Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, which \nincludes Chief Ministers of all the States, representatives from across the \npolitical spectrum, Gandhians, thinkers and eminent persons from all walks \nof life, has been constituted to formulate a Commemoration Programme. \nMy Government has earmarked `150 crore for the year 2018-19 for the \nactivities leading to the Commemoration. \nSection III - Fiscal Management \n138. I now turn to the fiscal situation for 2017-18 and f iscal  estimates \nfor 2018-19. \n139. In 2017-18, Central Government will be receiving GST revenues \nonly for 11 months, instead of 12 months.  T his will have fiscal effect. \nThere has also been some shortfall in Non-Tax revenues on account of \ncertain developments, including deferment of spectrum auction. A part of \nthis shortfall has been made up through higher direct tax revenues and \nbigger disinvestment receipts. \n140. Total Revised Estimates for expenditure in 2017-18 are `21 .57  lakh \ncrore (net of GST compensation transfers to the States) as against the \nBudget Estimates of `21.47 lakh crore.  \n141. Our Government assumed office in May, 2014 when fiscal deficit \nwas running at very high levels. Fiscal Deficit for 2013-14 was 4.4 %  of GDP.  \nThe Prime Minister and the Government have always attached utmost \npriority to prudent fiscal management and controlling fiscal deficit. As \nHon\u2019ble Members would recall, we embarked on the path of consistent \nfiscal reduction and consolidation in 2014.  Fiscal Deficit was brought \ndown to 4.1% in 2014-15 to 3.9% in 20 15-16, and to 3.5% in 2016-17.  25 \n \n \nRevised Fiscal Deficit estimates for 2017-18 are `5.95 lakh crore at 3.5% of \nGDP.  I am projecting a Fiscal Deficit of 3.3% of GDP for the year 2018-19.   \n142. In order to impart unquestionable credibility to the Government\u2019s \ncommitment for the revised fiscal glide path, I am proposing to accept key \nrecommendations of the Fiscal Reform and Budget Management \nCommittee relating to adoption of the Debt Rule and to bring down \nCentral Government\u2019s Debt to GDP ratio to 40%. Government has also \naccepted the recommendation to use Fiscal Deficit target as the key \noperational parameter. Necessary amendment proposals are included in \nthe Finance Bill.  26 \n \n \nPART  B \n \nMadam Speaker, \n143. I shall now present my tax proposals. \n144. The attempts made by our Government for reducing the cash \neconomy and for increasing the tax net have paid rich dividends. The \ngrowth rate of direct taxes in the financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18 has \nbeen significant. We ended the last year with a growth of 12.6% in direct \ntaxes and in the current year, the growth in direct taxes up to 15 th January, \n2018 is 18.7%. The average buoyancy in personal income tax of seven years \npreceding these two years comes to 1.1. In simple terms tax buoyancy of \n1.1 means that if nominal GDP growth rate of the country is 10%, the \ngrowth rate of personal income tax is 11%. However, the buoyancy in \npersonal income tax for financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18 (RE) is 1.95 \nand 2.11 respectively. This indicates that the excess revenue collected in \nthe last two financial years from personal income tax compared to the \naverage buoyancy pre 2016-17 amounts to a total of about `90,000 crores \nand the same can be attributed to the strong anti-evasion measures taken \nby the Government.  \n145. Similarly, there has been huge increase in the number of returns \nfiled by taxpayers. In financial year 2016-17, 85.51 lakhs new taxpayers filed \ntheir returns of income as against 66.26 lakhs in the immediately preceding \nyear. By including all filers as well as persons who did not file returns but \npaid tax by way of advance tax or TDS, we can derive the figure of Effective \nTaxpayer Base.  This number of effective tax payer base increased from 6.47 \ncrores at the beginning of F.Y.14-15 to 8.27 crores at the end of F.Y.16-17. \nWe are enthused by this success of our measures and we pledge to \ncontinue to take all such measures in future by which the black money is \ncontained and the honest taxpayers are rewarded. Demonetization was \nreceived well by honest taxpayers as \u201c imandari ka utsav \u201d only for this \nreason. \n146. Madam Speaker, recognising the need for facilitating compliance, \nGovernment had liberalized the presumptive income scheme for small \ntraders and entrepreneurs with annual turnover of less than `2 crores and \nintroduced a similar scheme for professionals with annual turnover of less \nthan `50 lakhs with the hope that there would be significant increase in \ncompliance. Under this scheme, 41% more returns were filed during this \nyear which shows that many more persons are joining the tax net under \nsimplified scheme. However, the turnover shown is still not encouraging. 27 \n \n \nThe Department has received 44.72 lakh  returns for assessment year \n2017-18 from individual, HUF and firms with a meagre average turnover of \n`17.97 lakhs  and an average tax payment of `7,000/- only. The tax \ncompliance behaviour of professionals is no better; the department has \nreceived 5.68 lakh  returns under the presumptive income scheme for \nassessment year 2017-18 with average gross receipts of `5.73 lakhs  only. \nAverage tax paid by them is only `35,000/-. \nTax incentive for promoting post-harvest activities of agriculture \n147. Madam Speaker, at present, hundred per cent deduction is allowed \nin respect of profit of co-operative societies which provide assistance to its \nmembers engaged in primary agricultural activities. Over the last few years, \na number of Farmer Producer Companies have been set up along the lines \nof co-operative societies which also provide similar assistance to their \nmembers. In order to encourage professionalism in post-harvest value \naddition in agriculture, I propose to allow hundred per cent deduction to \nthese companies registered as Farmer Producer Companies and having \nannual turnover up to `100 crores in respect of their profit derived from \nsuch activities for a period of five years from financial year 2018-19. This \nmeasure will encourage \u201cOperation Greens\u201d mission announced by me \nearlier and it will give a boost to Sampada Yojana. \nEmployment generation \n148. Currently, a deduction of 30% is allowed in addition to normal \ndeduction of 100 % in respect of emoluments paid to eligible new \nemployees who have been employed for a minimum period of 240 days \nduring the year under section 80-JJAA of the Income-tax Act. However, the \nminimum period of employment is relaxed to 150 days in the case of \napparel industry. In order to encourage creation of new employment,  \nI propose to extend this relaxation to footwear and leather industry. \nFurther, I also propose to rationalise this deduction of 30% by allowing the \nbenefit for a new employee who is employed for less than the minimum \nperiod during the first year but continues to remain employed for the \nminimum period in subsequent year.  \nIncentive for real estate \n149. Currently, while taxing income from capital gains, business profits \nand other sources in respect of transactions in immovable property, the \nconsideration or circle rate value, whichever is higher, is adopted and the \ndifference is counted as income both in the hands of the purchaser and \nseller. Sometimes, this variation can occur in respect of different properties 28 \n \n \nin the same area because of a variety of factors including shape of the plot \nand location. In order to minimize hardship in real estate transaction,  \nI propose to provide that no adjustment shall be made in a case where the \ncircle rate value does not exceed 5% of the consideration.  \nIncentivising micro, small and medium entrepreneurs \n150. In the Union Budget, 2017, I had announced the reduction of \ncorporate tax rate to 25% for companies whose turnover was less than `50 \ncrore in financial year 2015-16. This benefitted 96% of the total companies \nfiling tax returns. Towards fulfilment of my promise to reduce corporate tax \nrate in a phased manner, I now propose to extend the benefit of this \nreduced rate of 25% also to companies who have reported turnover up to \n`250 crore in the financial year 2016-17. This will benefit the entire class of \nmicro, small and medium enterprises which accounts for almost 99% of \ncompanies filing their tax returns. The estimate of revenue forgone due to \nthis measure is `7,000 crores during the financial year 2018-19. After this, \nout of about 7 lakh companies filing returns, about 7,000  companies which \nfile returns of income and whose turnover is above `250 crores will remain \nin 30% slab. The lower corporate income tax rate for 99% of the companies \nwill leave them with higher investible surplus which in turn will create more \njobs. \nRelief to salaried taxpayers \n151. The Government had made many positive changes in the personal \nincome-tax rate applicable to individuals in the last three years. Therefore,  \nI do not propose to make any further change in the structure of the income \ntax rates for individuals. There is a general perception in the society that \nindividual business persons have better income as compared to salaried \nclass. However, income tax data analysis suggests that major portion of \npersonal income-tax collection comes from the salaried class. For \nassessment year 2016-17, 1.89 crore  salaried individuals  have filed their \nreturns and have paid total tax of `1.44 lakh  crores which works out to \naverage tax payment of `76,306/- per individual  salaried taxpayer. As \nagainst this, 1.88 crores individual business  taxpayers including \nprofessionals, who filed their returns for the same assessment year paid \ntotal tax of `48,000 crores which works out to an average tax payment of \n`25,753/- per individual  business taxpayer. In order to provide relief to \nsalaried taxpayers, I propose to allow a standard deduction of `40,000/- in \nlieu of the present exemption in respect of transport allowance and \nreimbursement of miscellaneous medical expenses. However, the transport 29 \n \n \nallowance at enhanced rate shall continue to be available to differently- \nabled persons. Also other medical reimbursement benefits in case of \nhospitalization etc., for all employees shall continue. Apart from reducing \npaper work and compliance, this will help middle class employees even \nmore in terms of reduction in their tax liability. This decision to allow \nstandard deduction shall significantly benefit the pensioners also, who \nnormally do not enjoy any allowance on account of transport and medical \nexpenses. The revenue cost of this decision is approximately `8,000 crores. \nThe total number of salaried employees and pensioners who will benefit \nfrom this decision is around 2.5 crores. \nRelief to senior citizen \n152. A life with dignity is a right of every individual in general, more so for \nthe senior citizens. To care of those who cared for us is one of the highest \nhonours. To further the objective of providing a dignified life, I propose to \nannounce the following incentives for senior citizens: \n\uf0b7 Exemption of interest income on deposits with banks and post \noffices to be increased from `10,000/- to `50,000/- and TDS shall not \nbe required to be deducted on such income, under section 194A. \nThis benefit shall be available also for interest from all fixed deposits \nschemes and recurring deposit schemes. \n\uf0b7 Raising the limit of deduction for health insurance premium and/ or \nmedical expenditure from `30,000/- to `50,000/-, under section 80D. \nAll senior citizens will now be able to claim benefit of deduction up \nto `50,000/- per annum in respect of any health insurance premium \nand/or any general medical expenditure incurred.  \n\uf0b7 Raising the limit of deduction for medical expenditure in respect of \ncertain critical illness from, `60,000/- in case of senior citizens and \nfrom `80,000/- in case of very senior citizens, to `1 lakh in respect of \nall senior citizens, under section 80DDB. \nThese concessions will give extra tax benefit of `4,000 crores to senior \ncitizens. In addition to tax concessions, I propose to extend the Pradhan \nMantri Vaya Vandana Yojana up to March, 2020 under which an assured \nreturn of 8% is given by Life Insurance Corporation of India. The existing \nlimit on investment of `7.5 lakh per senior citizen under this scheme is also \nbeing enhanced to `15 lakh. \nTax incentive for International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) 30 \n \n \n153. The Government had endeavoured to develop a world class \ninternational financial services centre in India. In recent years, various \nmeasures including tax incentives have been provided in order to fulfil this \nobjective. To further this objective, I propose to provide two more \nconcessions for IFSC. In order to promote trade in stock exchanges located \nin IFSC, I propose to exempt transfer of derivatives and certain securities by \nnon-residents from capital gains tax. Further, non-corporate taxpayers \noperating in IFSC shall be charged Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) at \nconcessional rate of 9% at par with Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) \napplicable for corporates. \nFurther Measures to control cash economy:  \n154. Currently, the income of trusts and institutions is exempt if they \nutilise their income towards their objects in accordance with the relevant \nprovisions of the Income-tax Act. However, there is no restriction on these \nentities for incurring expenditure in cash. In order to have audit trail of the \nexpenses incurred by these entities, it is proposed that payments exceeding \n`10,000/- in cash made by such entities shall be disallowed and the same \nshall be subject to tax. Further, in order to improve TDS compliance by \nthese entities, I propose to provide that in case of non-deduction of tax, \n30% of the amount shall be disallowed and the same shall be taxed. \nRationalisation of Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) \n155. Madam Speaker, currently, long term capital gains arising from \ntransfer of listed equity shares, units of equity oriented fund and unit of a \nbusiness trust are exempt from tax. With the reforms introduced by the \nGovernment and incentives given so far, the equity market has become \nbuoyant. The total amount of exempted capital gains from listed shares and \nunits is around `3,67,000 crores  as per returns filed for A.Y.17-18. Major \npart of this gain has accrued to corporates and LLPs. This has also created a \nbias against manufacturing, leading to more business surpluses being \ninvested in financial assets. The return on investment in equity is already \nquite attractive even without tax exemption. There is therefore a strong \ncase for bringing long term capital gains from listed equities in the tax net. \nHowever, recognising the fact that vibrant equity market is essential for \neconomic growth, I propose only a modest change in the present regime.  \nI propose to tax such long term capital gains exceeding `1 lakh at the rate of \n10% without allowing the benefit of any indexation. However, all gains up \nto 31st January, 2018 will be grandfathered. For example, if an equity share \nis purchased six months before 31 st January, 2018 at `100/- and the highest \nprice quoted on 31 st January, 2018 in respect of this share is `120/-, there 31 \n \n \nwill be no tax on the gain of `20/- if this share is sold after one year from the \ndate of purchase. However, any gain in excess of `20 earned after 31 st \nJanuary, 2018 will be taxed at 10% if this share is sold after 31 st July, 2018.  \nThe gains from equity share held up to one year will remain short term \ncapital gain and will continue to be taxed at the rate of 15%. Further,  \nI also propose to introduce a tax on distributed income by equity oriented \nmutual fund at the rate of 10%. This will provide level playing field across \ngrowth oriented funds and dividend distributing funds. In view of \ngrandfathering, this change in capital gain tax will bring marginal revenue \ngain of about `20,000 crores in the first year. The revenues in subsequent \nyears may be more. \nHealth and Education Cess \n156. Madam Speaker, at present there is a three per cent cess on \npersonal income tax and corporation tax consisting of two per cent cess for \nprimary education and one per cent cess for secondary and higher \neducation. In order to take care of the needs of education and health of BPL \nand rural families,\n I have announced programs in Part A of my speech. To \nfund this, I propose to increase the cess by one per cent. The existing three \nper cent education cess will be replaced by a four per cent \u201cHealth and \nEducation Cess\u201d to be levied on the tax payable. This will enable us to \ncollect an estimated additional amount of `11,000 crores. \nE-assessment. \n157. We had introduced e-assessment in 2016 on a pilot basis and in \n2017, extended it to 102 cities with the objective of reducing the interface \nbetween the department and the taxpayers. With the experience gained so \nfar, we are now ready to roll out the E-assessment across the country, \nwhich will transform the age-old assessment procedure of the income tax \ndepartment and the manner in which they interact with taxpayers and \nother stakeholders. Accordingly, I propose to amend the Income-tax Act to \nnotify a new scheme for assessment where the assessment will be done in \nelectronic mode which will almost eliminate person to person contact \nleading to greater efficiency and transparency. \n158. My other tax proposals on direct tax are listed in Annexure 5 of my \nspeech. \nIndirect Tax.\n  \n159. On the Indirect Taxes side, this is the first budget after the roll out of \nthe Goods and Service Tax. Excise duties to a large extent and service tax 32 \n \n \nhave been subsumed in GST, along with corresponding duties on imports. \nHence, my budget proposals are mainly on the customs side. \n160. In this budget, I am making a calibrated departure from the \nunderlying policy in the last two decades, wherein the trend largely was to \nreduce the customs duty. There is substantial potential for domestic value \naddition in certain sectors, like food processing, electronics, auto \ncomponents, footwear and furniture. To further incentivise the domestic \nvalue addition and Make in India in some such sectors, I propose to increase \ncustoms duty on certain items. I propose to increase customs duty on \nmobile phones from 15% to 20%, on some of their parts and accessories to \n15% and on certain parts of TVs to 15%. This measure will promote creation \nof more jobs in the country. Details of changes made in rates of customs \nduty as well as certain changes made in the excise duty structure are given \nin Annexure 6 to my speech.  \n161. To help the cashew processing industry, I propose to reduce \ncustoms duty on raw cashew from 5% to 2.5%. \n162. I propose to abolish the Education Cess and Secondary and Higher \nEducation Cess on imported goods, and in its place impose a Social Welfare \nSurcharge, at the rate of 10% of the aggregate duties of Customs, on \nimported goods, to provide for social welfare schemes of the Government.  \nGoods which were hitherto exempt from Education Cesses on imported \ngoods will, however, be exempt from this Surcharge. In addition, certain \nspecified goods, mentioned in the Annexure 6 to my speech will attract the \nproposed Surcharge at the rate of 3% of the aggregate duties of customs \nonly.   \n163. I also propose to make certain changes to the Customs Act, 1962, to \nfurther improve ease of doing business in cross border trade, and to align \ncertain provisions with the commitments under the Trade Facilitation \nAgreement. To smoothen dispute resolution processes and to reduce \nlitigation, certain amendments are being made, to provide for pre-notice \nconsultation, definite timelines for adjudication and deemed closure of \ncases if those timelines are not adhered to.  \n164. With the roll out of GST, I propose to change the name of Central \nBoard of Excise and Customs [CBEC] to Central Board of Indirect Taxes and \nCustoms (CBIC). The necessary changes in law for this are proposed in the \nFinance Bill. \n165. Madam, while making the proposals in this year\u2019s Budget, we have \nbeen guided by our mission to especially strengthen agriculture, rural 33 \n \n \ndevelopment, health, education, employment, MSME and infrastructure \nsectors of Indian economy.  I am sure the New India which we aspire to \ncreate now will emerge. Swami Vivekanand had also envisioned decades \nago in his Memoirs of European Travel, \u2018\u2018You merge yourselves in the void \nand disappear, and let new India arise in your place. Let her arise \u2013 out of \nthe peasants\u2019 cottage, grasping the plough; out of the huts of the fisherman. \nLet her spring from the grocer\u2019s shop, from beside the oven of the fritter -\nseller.  Let her emanate from the factory, from marts, and from markets.  \nLet her emerge from groves and forests, from hills and mountains\u2019\u2019\n.  \n166. With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the \nHouse. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 34 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnnexure I \n(as referred in para 45) \n \nBudgetary & Non-Budgetary Resources on Agriculture & other Livelihood  \nProgrammes in Rural Area 35 \n \n \n        (`crore) \nName of \nScheme \nInfrastructure/ \nLivelihood / \nBoth \n2018-19 targets \nPhysical Target Financial Target \nGBS EBR Total \nM/o Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation \nPMKSY-AIBP Infrastructure 48 AIBP priority \nProjects by December \n2019 \n 15000 15000 \nPMKSY-HKKP \n(CADWM) \nInfrastructure Utilisation of irrigation \npotential  of 15 lakh \nHectare \n2300   2300 \nOther Schemes \nof MoWR, \nRD&GR \nBoth   1461   1461 \nSub-total MoWR,RD&GR   3761 15000 18761 \nDepartment of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare \nPradhan Mantri \nFasal Bima \nYojna \nLivelihood 98 million ha Gross \nCrop Area \n13000   13000 \nInterest Subsidy \nfor short term \ncredit to \nFarmers \nLivelihood   15000   15000 \nPradhan Mantri \nKrishi Sinchayee \nYojana \nInfrastructure Irrigation projects \ncovering 17.2 lakh ha \n4000   4000 \nLivelihood 15 lakh beneficiaries \nNational Food \nSecurity \nMission \nLivelihood 1.81 lakh beneficiaries 1500   1500 \nSub Mission on \nAgricultural \nMechanization \nInfrastructure 62466 centres for \nAgriculture Machinery \nand equipment, Farm \nMachinery Banks, Hi-\nTech Productive \nEquipment  \n1100   1100 \nLivelihood 17.81 lakh \nbeneficiaries \nRashtriya Krishi \nVikas Yojana \n(RKVY) \nInfrastructure 10,45,878 Cold \nStorage, Godowns, \nGlass Houses, Custom \nHiring Centers, Soil/ \nSeed Testing Labs, etc.  \n3100   3100 \nLivelihood 116.99 lakh \nbeneficiaries 36 \n \n \nMission for \nIntegrated \nDevelopment of \nHorticulture \nInfrastructure 3,30,436 centres 1599   1599 \nOther Schemes \nof D/o AC&FW \nBoth   2912   2912 \nSub-total of D/o AC&FW   42211   42211 \nMinistry of Food Processing \nScheme for \nMega Food \nParks \nInfrastructure 12 Mega Food Parks 390 1170 1560 \nLivelihood Direct & indirect \nemployment to 95000 \npersons in 2017-18 & \n2018-19 \nScheme for \nCold Chain and \nValue Addition \nInfrastructure \nInfrastructure 101 projects 220 880 1100 \nLivelihood Direct: 12000 & \nindirect: 63000 \nemployment in 2017-\n18 & 2018-19 \nOther Schemes \nof M/o Food \nProcessing \nBoth   210 640 850 \nSub-total of M/o Food \nProcessing \n  820 2690 3510 \nDepartment of Agriculture, Research and Education \nDARE Livelihood Production of 21960 \ntons Seeds, 255 lakh \nnos. planting material, \n132.5 lakh nos.
