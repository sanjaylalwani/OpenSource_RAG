    "content": "3 \n \n \n \nfiled, 800 crore invoices were  uploaded, and 105 crore e -way bills were \ngenerated. There has been extensive engagement with stakeholders. A \nsimplified new return system is being introduced from April 1, 2020.  \n11.  A former Prime Minister had once voiced a concern that the fruits of \nthe welfare schemes were not reaching the intended citizens \u2013 the common \nand deserving citizen was only receiving 15 paisa of every rupee sent for \nhim. Guided by \u201cSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas\u201d, our government \nand our Prime Minister added manifold speed and scaled up the \nimplementation of schemes and programmes that directly benefitted the \npoor and the disadvantaged.  I wish to list out only a few as examples: (a) \nwelfare schemes with Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) embedded in them; (b) \nsanitation and water as provision of basic needs and as a measure of \npreventive healthcare; (c) healthcare, through Ayushman Bharat; (d) clean \nenergy through Uj jwala and solar power; (e) financial i nclusion, credit \nsupport, insurance protection to vulnerable sections and pension scheme; \n(f) digital penetration with broadband and UPI; (g) Affordable Housing for all \nthrough PMAY. \nThe milestones achieved are unprecedented, globally recognised \nand benchmarked against international indices.   \n12. This strategy, changed the established order of a few individuals \ncornering most of the benefits and was appreciated by  the people. This had \nimmensely positive outcomes. We have moved on from a growth rate of \njust over 4% in 1950s to 6% in 1980s  and1990s. However, during 2014-19 \nwe clocked growth  of 7.4% on average with inflation, averaging around \n4.5%. It is worthwhile to note that inflation was close to 9% in the last two \ndecades of the last millennium and ranged 10.5% during 2009 -14. Between \n2006-16, India was able to raise 271 million people out of poverty, which we \nall should be proud of.    \n13.  We are now the fifth largest economy of the world. India\u2019s foreign \ndirect investment got elevated to the level of US$ 284 billion during 2014-\n19 from US$ 190 billioin that came in during the years 2009-14.  The Central \nGovernment debt that has been the bane of our economy got reduced , in \nMarch 2019, to 48.7% of GDP from a level of 52.2%in March 2014.  \n14.  With this backdrop, our government shall work towards taking the \ncountry forward so that we can leapfrog to the next level of health,  \nprosperity and well-being. We shall strive to bring Ease of living for every \ncitizen.  4 \n \n \n \n15.  I am mindful of presenting this budget in the backdrop of two cross -\ncutting developments:  \na) Proliferation of technologies, specially analytics, machine learning, \nrobotics, bio-informatics and Artificial Intelligence; and \nb) The number of people in the productive age group i.e. 15-65 years in \nIndia, being at its highest.  \n16. This combination is special to contemporary India. Across the world, \nif there is a shrinking of globalisation , equally, there is a debate on the \nefficacy of monetary policy  too.  The efforts we have made in the last five \nyears and the energy, enthusiasm and the innovation of our youth are the \nignition required to push forward. The Indian spirit of  entrepreneurship \nwhich weathered several storms over the centuries inspire and motivate us.  \nWe recognise the need to support and further energise this spirit.   \n17. This budget is woven around three prominent themes:  \nOne: Aspirational India in which all sections of the society s eek \nbetter standards of living, with access to health, education and better jobs.  \n Two: Economic development  for all, indicated in the Prime \nMinister\u2019s exhortation of \u201cSabka  Saath  , Sabka Vikas , Sabka Vishwas\u201d. This \nwould entail reforms across swathes of the economy. Simultaneously, it \nwould mean yielding more space for the private sector. Together, they \nwould ensure higher productivity and greater efficiency.  \n AND  \nThree: Ours shall be a Caring Society  that is both humane and \ncompassionate. Antyodaya is an article of faith.  \n18.  The digital revolution which has placed India in a unique leadership \nposition globally will see the next wave. We shall aim:  \n\uf0b7 To a chieve seamless delivery of services through Digital \ngovernance \n\uf0b7 To improve physical quality of life through National Infrastructure \nPipeline \n\uf0b7 Risk mitigation through Disaster Resilience \n\uf0b7 Social security through Pension and Insurance penetration.  \nEach one of these initiatives and their components would be bench -\nmarked to international standards  and the indices would be announced \nsoon.  5 \n \n \n \n19. To Summarize my introductory remarks, this Budget  Speaker Sir, is \ndedicated to provide \u201cEase of Living\u201d to all citizens.  As mentioned, a little \nearlier, the details under the three broad themes \u2013 Aspirational India, \nEconomic Development and Caring India are the flowers in the bouquet that \nis Ease of Living. Holding this bouquet together ar e two hands \u2013 one, \nCorruption free, policy -driven good governance and two, clean and sound \nfinancial sector.    \n20. The three themes described earlier form the basis of my subsequent \npresentation. They are the flowers of the bouquet that underline the overall \nconcept of \u201cEase of Living\u201d and need to uplift Governance, as pronounced \nby our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The chapter on Finances and \nsubsequent Part B on Taxes provide the necessary underpinning to the \nBudget that lays the guide map for next year and beyond. \nBefore, I move to elaborate on each of the three themes, I wish to \nrecite a small verse in Kashmiri: \n \n \n \n \n \nSaun Watan Gulzar Shalamaar Hyur \nDal Manz Pholvun Pamposh Hyuv \nNavjavan-an-hund, Vushun Khumaar Hyuv \nMyon Watan, Chyon Watan \nSaun Watan, Nundbony Watan \n(Everything that we do, all of us do, is for this beautiful country) \nPoem by Pandit Dinanath Koul \n6 \n \n \n \nAspirational India \n21. I shall cover programmes and plans related to: (1) Agricultur e \nIrrigation and Rural development (2) Wellness, Water and Sanitation and (3) \nEducation and Skills \nAgriculture, Irrigation and Rural Development \n22. Our government is committed to the goal of doubling farmers\u2019 \nincomes by 2022.  We have provide d energy sovereignty through KUSUM \nand input sovereignty through Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana. We have \nprovided resilience for 6.11 crores farmers insured under PM Fasal Bima \nYojana. Focus on cultivation of pulses, expansion of micro-irrigation through \nKrishi Sinchai Yojana, have raised the self -reliance of the country. Provision \nof any annual supplement of the income to the farmer, directly is done \nthrough PM -KISAN. Connectivity thr ough PMGSY, financial inclusion have \nhelped raise farm incomes. \n22 (1). Prosperity to farmers can be ensured by making farming \ncompetitive. For this, farm markets need to be liberalised. Distortions in \nfarm and livestock markets need to be removed. Purchas e of farm produce, \nlogistics and agri -services need copious investments. Substantial support \nand hand -holding of farm-based activities such as livestock, apiary, and  \nfisheries need to be provided for.  Farmers desire integrated solutions \ncovering storage, financing, processing and marketing.  \n23. Adopting sustainable cropping patterns  and bringing in more \ntechnology are integral to our plan.  All this and more can be achieved \nthrough working with and in cooperation with the States.  \nThe following 16 action points indicate our focus: \n23 (1). We propose to encourage those State governments who undertake \nimplementation of following model laws already issued by the Central \ngovernment:  \na) Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016 \nb) Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing  \n(Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017;, and 7 \n \n \n \nc) Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming \nand Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018 \n23 (2). Water stress related issues are now a serious concern across the \ncountry. Our government is proposing comprehensive measures for one \nhundred water stressed districts.  \n23 (3). In the Budget speech of July 2019, I had stated that \u201cannadata\u201d can \nbe \u201curjadata\u201d too. The PM -KUSUM scheme removed farmers\u2019 dependence \non diesel and kero sene and linked pump sets  to solar energy. Now, I \npropose to expand  the scheme to provide 20 lakh farmers for setting up \nstand-alone solar pumps; further we shall also help another 15 lakh farmers \nsolarise their grid -connected pump sets . In addition, a scheme to enable \nfarmers to set up solar power generation capacity on their fallow/barren \nlands and to sell it to the grid would be operationalized.  \n23 (4). Our government shall encourage balanced use of all kinds of \nfertilizers including the traditional organic and other innovative fertilizers. \nThis is a necessary step to change the prevailing incentive regime , which \nencourages excessive use of chemical fertilisers.  \n\u00aa\u0bae\u0bbf \u0ba4\u0bbf\u00af{\u0ba4\u0bbf \u0b89z \n\u0b86{\u0ba4\u0bbfv\u0099\u009c \u2013 82 \nBhumi tiruthi Unn \n- Wise, Old Tamil Woman Saint poet Aauvaiyar \u2013 Sangam Era \n\"Aaathichoodi\" verse 81 \nThe meaning of this saying is that one must \u201cfirst tend to till one's \nland and then eat\u201d. One must eat only after work. \n23 (5). India has an estimated capacity of 162 million MT of agri -\nwarehousing, cold storage, reefer van facilities etc.  NABARD will undertake \nan exercise to map and geo -tag them.  In addition, we propose creating \nwarehousing, in line  with Warehouse Development and Regulatory \nAuthority ( WDRA) norms. Our government will provide Viability Gap \nFunding for setting up such efficient warehouses at the block/taluk level.  \nThis can be achieved, where States can facilitate with land and are on a PPP \nmode.  Food Corporation of India (FCI)  and Central Warehousing \nCorporation (CWC) shall undertake such warehouse building on their land \ntoo. 8 \n \n \n \n23 (6). As a backward linkage, a Village Storage scheme is proposed to be \nrun by the SHGs.  This will provide farmers a good holding capacity and \nreduce their logistics cost.  Women, SHGs shall reg ain their position as \n\u201cDhaanya Lakshmi\u201d. \n23 (7). To build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, \ninclusive of milk, meat and fish, the Indian Railways will set up a \u201cKisan Rail\u201d \n\u2013 through PPP arrangements. There shall be refrigerated coaches in Express \nand Freight trains as well.  \n23 (8). Krishi Udaan will be launched by the Ministry of Civil Aviation on \ninternational and national routes. This will immensely help improve value \nrealisation especially in North-East and tribal districts.  \n23 (9). Horticulture sector with its current produce of 311million MT \nexceeds production of food grains .  For better marketing and export, we \npropose supporting States which, adopting a cluster basis,  will focus on \n\u201cone product one district\u201d.  \n23 (10). Integrated farming systems in rainfed areas shall be expanded. \nMulti-tier cropping, bee -keeping, solar pumps, solar energy production in \nnon-cropping season will be added. Zero -Budget Natural Farming \n(mentioned in July 2019 budget) shall also be included.  The portal on \u201cjaivik \nkheti\u201d \u2013 online national organic products market will also be strengthened.  \n23 (11). Financing on Negotiable Warehousing Receipts (e -NWR) has \ncrossed more than`6000 crore. This will be integrated with e-NAM.  \n23 (12). Non-Banking Finance Companies ( NBFCs)and cooperatives  are \nactive in the agriculture credit space.  The NABARD re -finance scheme will \nbe further expanded.  Agriculture credit target for the year 2020 -21 has \nbeen set at ` 15 lakh crore. All eligible beneficiaries of PM -KISAN will be \ncovered under the KCC scheme.  \n23 (13). Our government intends to eliminate Foot and Mouth disease, \nbrucellosis in cattle and also peste des petits ruminants  (PPR) in sheep and \ngoat by 2025.  Coverage of artificial insemination shall be increased from \nthe present 30 % to 70%. MNREGS would be dovetailed to develop fodder \nfarms. Further, we shall facilitate doubling of milk processing capacity from \n53.5 million MT to 108 million MT by 2025.  \n23 (14). Blue Economy: Our government proposes to put in place a \nframework for development, management and conservation of marine \nfishery resources.   9 \n \n \n \n23 (15). Youth in coastal areas benefit t hrough fish processing and \nmarketing.  By 2022 -23, I propose raising fish production to 200 lakh \ntonnes. Growing of algae, sea-weed and cage Culture will also be promoted.  \nOur government will involve youth in fishery extension through 3477 \nSagar Mitras and 500 Fish Farmer Producer Organisati ons. We hope to raise \nfishery exports to ` 1 lakh crore by 2024-25.  \n23 (16). Under Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana for alleviation of poverty , 58 \nlakh SHGs have been mobilised. We shall further expand on SHGs.   \n24. Now, for the fund allocation for the 16 different steps mentioned \nabove, they are being stated under two different categories: \nFor the sector comprising of Agriculture and allied activities, \nIrrigation and Rural Development an allocation of about ` 2.83 lakh c rore \nhas been made for the year 2020-21 . Its divided,  inter-alia; \na) For Agriculture, Irrigation & allied activities     - ` 1.60 lakh crore \nb) For Rural development & Panchayati Raj          -  ` 1.23 lakh crore \nWellness, Water and Sanitation \nUnder Aspirational India, I shall now speak about Wellness, Water and \nSanitation.   \n25.  We have a holistic vision of healthcare  that translates into wellness \nof the citizen. Mission Indradhanush has been expanded to cover 12 such \ndiseases, including five new vaccines . FIT India movement is a vital part of \nfight against Non communicable diseases coming out of life style issues  . A \nvery focused safe water (Jal Jeevan Mission) and comprehensive sani tation \nprogram (Swachch Bharat Mission) have been launched to support the \nhealth vision. That would reduce the disease burden on the poor. \n26. Presently, under PM Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) , there are more \nthan 20,000 empanelled hospitals . We need more in Tier -2 and Tier-3 cities \nfor poorer people under this scheme.  10 \n \n \n \n26 (1). It is proposed to set up Viability Gap funding window for setting up \nhospitals in the PPP mode. In the first phase, those Aspirational Districts will \nbe covered, where presently there are no Ayushman empanelled hospitals . \nThis would also provide large scale employment opportunities to youth.  \nProceeds from taxes on medical devices would be used to support this vital \nhealth infrastructure \n26 (2). Using machine learning and AI, in the Ayushman Bharat scheme, \nhealth authorities and the medical fraternity can  target disease with an \nappropriately designed Preventive regime. \n27.  \u201cTB Harega Desh Jeetega\u201d campaign has been launched. I propose to \nstrengthen these efforts realise our commitment to end Tuberculosis by \n2025. \n28.  I propose to expand Jan Aushadhi Kendra Scheme  to all districts \noffering 2000 medicines and 300 surgicals by 2024.  \nI have provided for the health sector about `69,000 crore s that is \ninclusive of ` 6400 crores for Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY)  \n29. Our government is committed to ODF Plus in order  to sustain ODF \nbehaviour and to ensure that no one is left behind.  Now, more needs to be \ndone towards liquid and grey water management. Focus would also be on \nSolid waste collection, source segregation and processing.  \nTotal allocation for Swachh Bharat Mission is about `12,300 crore in \n2020-21.   \n30. Aiming to provide piped water supply to all households, Prime \nMinister announced from the Red Fort the Jal Jeevan Mission .  Our \ngovernment has approved `3.60 lakh crore for this Mission. This scheme \nalso places emphasis on augmenting local water sources, recharging existing \nsources and will promote water harvesting  and de-salination. Cities with \nover a  million population will be encouraged to meeting this objective \nduring the current year itself.  \nDuring the yea r 2020-21 the scheme would be provided budget of  \n` 11,500 crore.  11 \n \n \n \nEducation and Skills \nThe third and the final item under Aspirational India is Education \nand Skills.  \n31. By 2030, India is set to have the largest working -age population in \nthe world. Not only do they need literacy but they need both job and life \nskills. Dialogues have been held with State Education Ministries, Members \nof Parliament and other stake -holders about Education policy .  Over 2 lakh \nsuggestions were also received. The New Education Policy will be \nannounced soon.  \n32. It is felt that our education system needs greater inflow of finance to \nattract talented teachers, innovat e and build be tter labs. Therefore s teps \nwould be taken to enable sourcing External Commercial Borrowings and FDI \nso as to able to deliver higher quality education. \n33. Students in the general stream (vis -\u00e0-vis services or technology \nstream) need their employability improved.  Abo ut 150 higher educational \ninstitutions will start apprenticeship embedded degree/diploma courses  by \nMarch 2021.  \n34. The government proposes to start a programme whereby urban \nlocal bodies across the country would provide internship opportunities to \nfresh engineers for a period up to one year.  \n35. In order to provide quality education to students of deprived section \nof the society as well as those who do not have access to higher education , \nit is proposed to start degree level full-fledged online education \nprogramme. This shall be offered only by institutions who are ranked within \ntop 100 in the National Institutional Ra nking framework. Initially, only a few \nsuch institutions would be asked to offer such programmes.  \n36. India should be a preferred destination for higher education. Hence, \nunder its \u201cStudy in India\u201d programme, Ind-SAT is proposed to be held in \nAsian and  African countries. It shall be used for benchmarking foreign \ncandidates who receive scholarships for studying in Indian higher education \ncentres.  12 \n \n \n \n37. A National Police University  and a National Forensic Science \nUniversity are being proposed in the domain  of policing science, forensic \nscience, cyber-forensics etc.  \n38. There is a shortage of qualified medical doctors, both  general \npractitioners as well as specialists.  In order to meet this requirement; \n38 (1). It is proposed to attach a medical college to  an existing district \nhospital in PPP mode. Th ose states that fully allow the fac ilities of the \nhospital to the medical college and wish to provide land at a concession, \nwould be able to receive Viability Gap Funding. Details of the scheme would \nbe worked out. \n38 (2). National Board of Examination imparts PG medical qualifications ; \nDiploma  and fellow of National Board (DNB /FNB). The Government will, \ntherefore encourage large hospitals with sufficient capacity to offer resident \ndoctors DNB/FNB courses under the National Board of Examinations. \n39. There exists a huge demand for teachers, nurses, para -medical staff \nand care -givers abroad.  However, their skill sets, many a time, do not \nmatch the employer\u2019s standards and therefore need to be improved. I \npropose that special bridge courses be designed by the Ministries of Health, \nSkill Development together with professional bodies to bring in equivalence. \nLanguage requirements of various countries  need also to be included .  All \nthese should be achieved through special training packages. \nOur Government proposes to provide about ` 99,300 crore for \neducation sector in 2020-21 and about ` 3,000 crores for skill development.  \nEconomic Development \nIndustry, Commerce and Investment  \nThe guilds of Saraswati -Sindhu civilization & the Harappan seals are \nremarkable. They belong to 3300 BCE.  Words from the Indus Script -\nhieroglyphs have been deciphered. Commerce and trade related words \nshow how India  for a millennia is continuing as rich  in skills,  metallurgy, \ntrade etc . \u201cTakara Kolimi=Tin smithery\u201d, \u201c Sreni \u201c= Guild  ,\u201d Sethi\u201d=  \nwholesale merchant, \u201cPoddar\u201d= Assayer of metal into treasury. 13 \n \n \n \n40. Entrepreneurship has always been the strength of India. Even today, \nyoung men and women have given up greener pastures elsewhere to \ncontribute to India\u2019s growth. They are risk -taking and come up with \ndisruptive solutions to festering challenges.  Equally, established old \nindustries are resetting themselves in a changing global and domestic \nsituation. We recognise the knowledge, skills and risk-taking capabilities of \nour youth. He is no longer the job seeker. He is creator of jobs. Now we \nwish to create more opportunities and remove road-blocks from his path.   \nI propose to set up an Investment Clearance Cell that will provide \n\u201cend to end\u201d facilitation and support, including pre -investment advisory, \ninformation related to land banks and facilitate clearances at Centre and \nState level.  It will work through a portal.  \n41. There is a case for maximising the benefits of three separately \ndeveloping economic activit ies: (1) the upcoming economic corridors; (2) \nrevitalisation of manufacturing activities; and (3) Tec hnology and the \ndemands of aspirational classes. We have to benefit from the ir \nconvergence. Hence, it is proposed to develop five new smart cities  in \ncollaboration with States in PPP mode.  Such sites would be chosen that \noffer the best choices in terms of aforementioned principles.  \n42. India needs to manufacture Networked products. That will make it a \npart of global value chains. This in turn gets more investment and generates \nmore employment for our youth. \n42 (1). Electronics manufacturing industry is very competitive and India has \nshown its cost advantages.  The potential of this industry in job creation is \nimmense.  India needs to boost domestic manufacturing and attract large \ninvestments in the electronics value chain. Here, I propose a scheme \nfocussed on encouraging manufacture of mobile phones, electronic \nequipment and semi -conductor packaging.  Details would be announced \nlater.  \n42(2). With suitable modifications, this scheme can be adapted for \nmanufacture of medical devices too \n43. India imports si gnificant quantity of technical textiles worth US$ 16 \nbillion every year.  To reverse this trend and to position India as a global 14 \n \n \n \nleader in Technical Textiles, a National Technical Textiles Mission is \nproposed with a four-year implementation period from 2020-21 to 2023-24 \nat an estimated outlay of ` 1480 crore.  \n44.  From the Red Fort, our Prime Minister spoke about quality and \nstandards when he spoke of \u201cZero Defect-Zero Effect\u201d manufacturing. In \nSeptember last year, I had called for a time -bound adoption by industry of \nall necessary, mandatory technical standards and their effective \nenforcement. All Ministries, during the course of this year, would be issuing \nquality standard orders.  \n45. To achieve higher export credit disbursement, a new scheme, NIRVIK \nis being launched, which provides for higher insurance coverage, reduction \nin premium for small exporters and simplified procedure for claim \nsettlements.   \n46. It is proposed to digitally refund to exporters, duties and taxes levied \nat the Central, State and local levels , such as electricity duties  and VAT on \nfuel used for transportation , which are not getting exempted or refunded \nunder any other existing mechanism. This Scheme for Reversion of duties \nand taxes on exported products will be launched this year.   \n47. It is the vision of the Prime Minister that each District should \ndevelop as an export hub. Efforts of the Centre and State governments are \nbeing synergised and institutional mechanisms are being created.  \n48. Government e -Marketplace (G eM) is moving ahead for creating a \nUnified Procurement System  in the country for providing a single platform \nfor procurement of goods, services and works.  It offers a great opp ortunity \nfor Medium, Small and micro Enterprises(MSMEs). 3.24 lakh vendors are \nalready on this platform.  Its proposed to take its turnover to ` 3lakh crores.  \nI propose to provide about ` 27,300 crore for development and \npromotion of Industry and Commerce  for the year 2020-21.  \nUnder the theme \u201cEconomic Development\u201d, the second focus is on \nInfrastructure. 15 \n \n \n \nInfrastructure  \n49. Hon\u2019ble Speaker, Sir,  in his Independence Day speech 2019, Prime \nMinister had highlighted that ` 100 lakh crore  would be invested on \ninfrastructure over the next 5 years. As a follow  up measure, I had launched \nthe National Infrastructure Pipeline on 31 st December 2019  of ` 103 lakh \ncrore. It consists of more than 6500 projects across sectors and are  \nclassified as per their size and stage of development.  \nThese new projects will include housing, safe drinking water, access \nto clean and affordable energy, healthcare for all, world -class educational \ninstitutes, modern railway stations, airports, bus ter minals, metro and \nrailway transportation, logistics and warehousing, irrigation projects, etc.  \nThe National Infrastructure Pipeline envisions improving the ease of living \nfor each individual citizen in the country. It\u2019s  also will bring in generic and \nsectoral reforms in development, operation and maintenance of these \ninfrastructure projects. \nA huge employment opportunity exists for India\u2019s youth in \nconstruction, operation and maintenance of infrastructure. National Skill \nDevelopment Agency will give speci al thrust to infrastructure -focused skill \ndevelopment opportunities. \n50 (1).  I propose to set up a project preparation facility for infrastructure \nprojects.  This programme would actively involve young engineers, \nmanagement graduates and economists from our Universities.  \n50 (2). It is also proposed to direct all infrastructure agencies of the \ngovernment to involve youth -power in start-ups. They will help in rolling \nout value added services in quality public infrastructure for citizens.  \n51. A National Logistics Policy will be released soon.  Inter alia ; it will \nclarify the roles of the Union Government, State Governments and key \nregulators. It will create a single window e -logistics market and focus on \ngeneration of employment, skills and making MSMEs competitive.  \n52. Accelerated development of highways will be undertaken. This will \ninclude development of 2500 Km access control highways, 9000 Km  of \neconomic corridors, 2000 Km of coastal and land port roads and 2000 Km of \nstrategic highways. 16 \n \n \n \nDelhi-Mumbai Expressway and two other packages would be \ncompleted by 2023 . Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway would also be started.  \n53. FASTag mechanism encourages us towards greater \ncommercialisation of our highways so that NHAI can raise more resources.  I \npropose to monetise at least twelve lots of highway bundles  of over 6000 \nKm before 2024.  \n54. In carrying out its duty, the Indian Railways performs a service to the \nnation.   \na) Within 100 days of assumption of this government, it has \ncommissioned 550 wi-fi facilities in as many stations.  \nb) Eliminated unmanned crossings \nc) Aims to achieve electrification of 27000 Km of tracks.  \nThis will call for optimisation of costs.  Railways has small operating \nsurplus. About Indian Railways, there are five measures, among others, that \nI wish to highlight:  \n\uf0b7 Setting up a large solar power capacity alongside the rail tracks, on \nthe land owned by the railways. A proposal is under consideration.  \n\uf0b7 Four station re -development projects and operation of 150 \npassenger trains would be done through PPP mode. The process of \ninviting private participation is underway.  \n\uf0b7 More Tejas type trains will connect iconic tourist destinations.  \n\uf0b7 High speed train between Mumbai to Ahmedabad would be actively \npursued.  \n\uf0b7 148 km long Bengaluru Suburban transport project at a cost of  \n` 18600 cr ore, would have fares on metro model. Central \nGovernment would provide 20% of equ ity and facilitate external \nassistance up to 60% of the project cost. 17 \n \n \n \n55. Our sea-ports need to be more efficient. Technology has to used to \nimprove performance.  A governance framework keeping with global \nbenchmarks needs to be put in place.  \nThis government would consider corporatizing at least  one major \nport and subsequently its listing on the stock exchanges.  \n56. Inland Waterways received a boost in the last five years. The Jal \nVikas Marg on National Waterway-1 will be completed. Further, the 890 Km \nDhubri-Sadiya connectivity will be done by 2022.  \nDeveloping waterways has its impact on the eco -system on both the \nbanks of the river. Our Prime Minister has conceptualised  \u201cArth Ganga\u201d. \nPlans are afoot to energise economic activity along river banks.  \n57. Air traffic has been  growing rapidly in the country as compared to  \nglobal average.  One hundred more airports would be developed by 2024 to \nsupport Udaan scheme. It is expected that the air fleet number shall go up \nfrom the present 600 to 1200 during this time.  \nI propose to provide about ` 1.70 lakh crore for transport  \nInfrastructure in 2020-21.  \n58. Taking electricity to every household has been a major achievement. \nHowever, the distribution sector, particul arly the DISCOMS are under \nfinancial stress. The Ministry intends to promote \u201csmart\u201d metering. I urge \nall the States and Union Territories to replace conventional energy meters \nby prepaid smart meters in the next 3 years. Also, this would give \nconsumers th e freedom to choose the suppl ier and rate as per their \nrequirements.  \nFurther measure to reform DISCOMs would be taken. \nI propose to provide about ` 22,000 crore to power and renewable \nenergy sector in 2020-21 \n59. In the upstream sector of oil and gas, the  Open Acreage Licensing \nPolicy (OALP) is a success having awarded 1,37,000 sq km for exploration to \nprivate sector and to the  CPSEs.  City gas distribution rights are also \nawarded.   18 \n \n \n \n60 (1). Further, it is proposed to expand the national gas grid from the \npresent 16200 km to 27000 km, and  \n60 (2). To deepen gas markets in India , further reforms will be undertaken \nto facilitate transparent price discovery and ease of transactions.  \nNew Economy \n61. The new economy is based on innovations that disrupt established \nbusiness models. Artificial intelligence, Internet -of-Things (IoT), 3D printing, \ndrones, DNA data storage, quantum computing, etc., are re -writing the \nworld economic order. India has already embraced new paradigms such as \nthe sharing economy wi th aggregator platforms displacing conventional \nbusinesses. Government has harnessed new technologies to enable direct \nbenefit transfers and financial inclusion on a scale never imagined before.  \n62. It is now a clich\u00e9 \u2013 \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d and it is tru e that Analytics, \nFintech and Internet of Things ( IOT) are changing the way we deal with our \nlives. To take advantage of this, I propose:  \n62 (1). To bring out soon a policy to enable private sector to build Data \nCentre parks throughout the country.  It will enable our firms to skilfully \nincorporate data in every step of their value chains.  \n62 (2).   Our vision is that all \u201cpublic institutions\u201d at Gra m Panchayat level \nsuch as Anganwadis, health and wellness centres, government schools, PDS \noutlets, post offices and police stations will be provided  with digital \nconnectivity.  So, Fibre to the Home (FTTH) connections through Bharatnet \nwill link 100,000 gram panchayats this year.  \nIt is proposed to   provide   ` 6000   crore to  Bharatnet programme \nin 2020-21.  \n63. We need to expand the base for knowledge -driven enterprises. \nIntellectual property creation and protection will play an important role. \nSeveral measures are proposed in this regard , which will benefit the Start-\nups.  19 \n \n \n \n63 (1).  A digital platform would be promoted that would facilitate seamless \napplication and capture of IPRs. Also, in an Institute of Excellence, a Centre \nwould be established that would work on the complexity and innovation in \nthe field of Intellectual Property.  \n63 (2). Knowledge Translation Clusters would be set up across different \ntechnology sectors including new and emerging areas.  \n63 (3). For designing, fabrication and validation of proof of concept, and \nfurther scaling up Technology Clusters, harbouring such  test beds and small \nscale manufacturing facilities would be established.  \n63 (4). Mapping of India\u2019s genetic landscape is critical for next generation \nmedicine, agriculture and for bio -diversity management.  To support this \ndevelopment, we will initiat e two new national level Science Schemes, to \ncreate a comprehensive database.  \n63 (5).   The government proposes to provide early life funding, including a \nseed fund to support ideation and development of early stage Start-ups.  \n64. Quantum technology is opening up new frontiers in computing, \ncommunications, cyber security with wide -spread applications. It is \nexpected that lots of commercial applications would emerge from \ntheoretical constructs which are developing in this area.   \nIt is proposed to provide an outlay of ` 8000 crore over a period five \nyears for the National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications.  \nCaring Society \nIn our third theme we focus on Women & Child, Social Welfare ; \nCulture and Tourism and also on Environment and Climate Change. \nWomen & Child, Social Welfare  \n65.  I am pleased to inform the House that \u201cBeti Bachao Beti Padhao\u201d \nhas yielded tremendous results. Gross enrolment ratio of girls across all \nlevels of education is now higher than boys. At elementary level, it is 94.32 \n% as against 89.28% for boys. At Secondary level , it is 81.32 % as compared \nto 78 %,  At higher secondary level girls have achieved a level of 59.70 % as \ncompared to 57.54 % for boys. 20 \n \n \n \n66. Health of mother and child are closely corelated. Nutrition is the \ncritical component of health. To improve the nutritional status of children \n(0-6 years), adolescent girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers, our \nPrime Minister launched a \u201cPoshan Abhiya n\u201d in 2017 -18.  More than six \nlakh anganwadi workers are equipped with smart phones to upload the \nnutritional status of more than 10 crore households.  The scale of these \ndevelopments is unprecedented.  \n67. Women\u2019s age of marriage was increased from fifteen years to \neighteen years in 1978, by amending erstwhile Sharda Act of 1929. As India \nprogresses further,  opportunities open u p for women to pursue higher \neducation and careers. There are  imperatives of lowering MMR as well as \nimprovement of nutriti on levels. Entire issue about age of a girl entering \nmotherhood needs to be seen in this light. I propose to appoint a task force \nthat will present its recommendations in six months\u2019 time. \nI propose to provide ` 35600 crore for nutrition-related programmes \nfor the financial year 2020-21.  \n68. In continuing with our government\u2019s commitment to the welfare of \nwomen, this budget provides for about ` 28,600 crore for programs that are \nspecific to women. \n69.  Our government is determined that there shall be no manual \ncleaning of sewer systems or septic tanks. Suitable technologies for such \ntasks have been identified by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The \nMinistry is working with urban local bodies f or the adoption of these \ntechnologies. We will now take this to its logical conclusion through \nlegislative and institutional changes. Financial support for wider acceptance \nof such technologies will be provided.  \n70 In furthering this government\u2019s commitment towards the welfare of \nScheduled Castes and Other Backward classes, I propose a budget provision \nof about ` 85,000 crore for 2020-21.  \n71. In furthering development and welfare of Scheduled tribes, I provide in \nthe Budget for the year 2020-21 an amount of about ` 53,700 crore. 21 \n \n \n \n72. This government is mindful of the concerns of senior citizens and \nDivyang. Accordingly, an enhanced allocation of about ` 9,500 crore is being \nprovided for 2020-21. \nCulture & Tourism  \n73. Our government proposes to establish an Indian Institute of \nHeritage and Conservation under Ministry of Culture; it shall have the status \nof a deemed University to start with. Acquisition of knowledge in disciplines \nsuch as museology  and archaeology are essential for collecting and \nanalysing scientific evidence of such findings and for dissemination through \nhigh quality museums.  Currently lack of trained man -power is a handicap \nfor both these disciplines. This also affects tourism.  \n74. Five archaeological sites would be developed as iconic sites with  on-\nsite Museum s. They are: Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Hastinapur (Uttar Pradesh) \nShivsagar (Assam), Dholavira (Gujarat) and Adichanallur (Tamil Nadu). \n75. Our Prime Minister in January 2020 announced re -curation of the \nIndian Museum in Kolkata, which is the oldest in the country.  \n75 (1). In the historic Old Mint building  Kolkata, a museum on Numismatics  \nand Trade will also be located.  Four more museums from across the \ncountry shall be take n up for renovation and re -curation so that a world \nclass experience can be offered to visitors.  Our government shall  also \nsupportsetting up of a Tribal Museum in Ranchi (Jharkhand). \n75 (2). A maritime museum would be set up at Lothal  - the Harrapan age \nmaritime site near Ahmedabad, by Ministry of Shipping.   \nI propose to provide ` 3,150 crore for Ministry of Culture for  \n2020-21.  \n76. India has moved up from rank 65 in 2014 to 34 in 2019 in the Travel \n& Tourism Competitive Index (World Economic Forum). Foreign exchange \nearnings grew 7.4% to `1.88 lakh crores for the period January to \nNovember 2019 from `1.75 lakh crores 22 \n \n \n \nGrowth of tourism directly relates to growth and employment. \nStates have a critical role to play. I expect the State governments to develop \na roadmap for certain identified destinations and formulate financial plans \nduring 2021 against which specified grants will be made available to the \nStates in 2020-21.  \nFor purpose of tourism promotion , I propose to allocate ` 2,500 \ncrore for 2020-21.  \nEnvironment & Climate Change \n77. In September 2019, the Prime Minister has launched the Coalition \nfor Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) with its Secretariat in Delhi.  This \nglobal partnership is the second such international initiative after the \nlaunch of International Solar Alliance in 2015. This Global Partnership will \nhelp in addressing a number of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , as \nalso the aims of  Sendai framework. It will  enhance clima te change \nadaptation with a focus on disaster resilient infrastructure  \n78. India submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution, under the \nParis Agreement in 2015 on a  \u201cbest effort\u201d basis, keeping in mind the \ndevelopment imperative of the country. Its i mplementation effectively \nbegins on 1st January 2021. Our commitments as action will be executed in \nvarious sectors by the Departments/Ministries concerned through the \nnormal budgeting process.  \n79. There are yet , thermal power plants that are old and their carbon \nemission levels are high.  \nFor such power plants, we propose that utilities running them would \nbe advised to close them, if their emission is above the pre -set norms.  The \nland so vacated can be put to alternative use.  \n80. In large cities  having population above one million , clean air is a \nmatter of concern. The government proposes to encourage such States that \nare formulating and implementing plans for ensuring cleaner air in cities \nabove one million. Parameters for the incentives would be notified by the \nMinistry of Environment, F orests and Climate change. Allocation for this \npurpose is  `4400 crore for 2020-21.  23 \n \n \n \n\u0ba8\u0083\u0bb2 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u009e \n\u0baa\u008e\u0ba3\u008e\u0baf\u008e}\u0bc8\u0bae, \u0bc6\u0b9a\u0083\u0bb5\u007f \u0bb5\u008e\u0bc8\u0bb3\u0bb5\u008e}\u0baa\u007f \u0b8f\u0bae\u007f  \n\u0b85\u0ba3\u008e\u0bc6\u0baf}\u0baa \u0ba8\u0bbey\u009c\u0086 \u0bc8\u0bb5|\u00a2. \n \u0094\u0bb1\u0084 - 738 \n(The meaning of this kural is that Freedom from illness, wealth, produce, \nhappiness and protection (to subjects); these five, are the ornaments of a \nkingdom). \nGovernance \n81. Hon\u2019ble Speaker, Sir, all the while I have explained the colour and \ncomposition of the bouquet of flowe rs \u2013 schemes and programmes. They \nwere grouped under Aspirational India, Economic Development and Caring \nIndia.  Now I speak about the two hands that will hold them. One such hand \nis Governance \u2013 clean, corruption-free, policy driven and good in intent and  \nmost importantly trusting in faith . Trusting every citizen, the aspirational \nyouth, the hard -working women, the risk -taking entrepreneur, the eve r \nhopeful and untiring farmer or the wise and old senior citizen. Many among \nthem are taxpayers.  Others may n ot be taxpayers today.  Our Prime \nMinister has laid before us Ease of Living as a goal to be achieved on behalf \nof all citizens.  An important aspect of both ease of living and ease of doing \nbusiness is fairness and efficiency of tax administration.  We wi sh to \nenshrine in the statutes  a \u201ctaxpayer charter\u201d through this budget.  Our \ngovernment would like to reassure taxpayers that we remain committed to \ntaking measures so that our citizens are free from harassment of any kind.  \n82. There has been a debate about b uilding into statutes , criminal \nliability for acts that are civil in nature . Hence, for Companies Act, certain \namendments are proposed to be made that will correct this. Similarly, other \nlaws would also be examined, where such provisions exist and a ttempts \nwould be made to correct them.  \n83.  The Government intends to introduce major reforms in recruitment \nto Non-Gazetted posts in governments and public sector banks. At present, \ncandidates have to appear for multiple examinations conducted by multipl e \nagencies at different points of time, for similar posts This places enormous 24 \n \n \n \nburden on time, effort and cost of young people.  To mitigate their hardship \nfaced, it is proposed to set up a National Recruitment Agency (NRA) as an \nindependent, professional,  specialist organisation for conduct of a \ncomputer-based online Common Eligibility Test for recruitment to Non -\nGazetted posts. A test -centre in every district, particularly in the \nAspirational Districts would be set up.   \n84. For speedy disposal of commercial and other disputes, Government \nhas constituted various Tribunals and specialised bodies. It is proposed to \nevolve a robust mechanism for appointment including direct recruitment to \nthese bodies to attract best talents and professional experts.  \n85. A stable and predictable business environment is a key objective of \nthis government.  There is also a strong argument for ensuring that \ncontracts are honoured.  India has a sound framework related to Contracts \nAct. We shall deliberate upon strengthening it.  \n86. There is a growing need for the Indian Statistical system to meet the \nchallenges of real time monitoring of our increasingly complex economy. \nData must have strong credibility.  The proposed new National Policy on \nOfficial Statistics would use latest technology including AI. It would lay down \na road -map towards modernised data collection, integrated information \nportal and timely dissemination of information.  \n87. I am happy to inform that India will host G 20 presidency in the year \n2022 - the year of 75th anniversary of independence of Indian Nation. During \nthis presidency, India would be able to drive considerably the global \neconomic and development agenda. For this historic occasion, I allocate a \nsum of ` 100 crore to begin the preparations. \n88. North Eastern region has a very high priority in Government\u2019s \nDevelopmental agenda. Government is ensuring smooth access to financial \nassistance from multilateral and bilateral funding agencies to help introduce \ninnovative a nd global best practices. Central Government has effectively \nused an online portal to reduce gestation period of online. This has \nimproved the flow of funds to the northeast region.  \n89. The Government is fully committed to supporting the all -round \ndevelopment of the newly formed Union Territories of J&K and the Union 25 \n \n \n \nTerritory of Ladakh. Accordingly,  an amount of `30,757 crore has been \nprovided for the Financial Year 2020 -21. An amount of `5,958 crore has \nbeen provided for the Union Territory of Ladakh \nFinancial Sector  \n90. If Governance was described as one of the pair of hands holding the \nbouquet consisting of Aspirational India, Economic Development and Caring \nIndia, the other is the Financial Sector.  A clean, reliable and robust financial \nsector is critical to the economy.  In our efforts to achieve the USD 5 trillion \neconomy, the financial architecture should keep evolving and mo ve from \nstrength to strength.  \n91. We had earlier approved consolidation of 10 banks into four.  In the \nlast few years, Go vernment of India has infused  about ` 3,50,000 crore by \nway of capital into Public Sector Banks for regulatory and growth purposes.  \nGovernance reforms would be carried out in these banks, so that they \nbecome more competitive.  \nA few among them will be encouraged to approach capital market to \nraise additional capital.  \n92. I wish to inform this august House that robust mechanism is in place \nto monitor the health of all Scheduled Commercial Banks and that \ndepositors\u2019 money is safe.  \nFurther, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation \n(DICGC) has been permitted to increase Deposit Insurance Coverage for a \ndepositor, which is now ` one lakh to ` five lakh per depositor.  \n93. To strengthen the Cooperative Banks, amendments  to the Banking \nRegulation Act are proposed for increasing professionalism, enabling access \nto capital and improving governance and oversight for sound banking \nthrough the RBI.  \n94. The limit for NBFCs to be eligible for debt recovery under the \nSecuritization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of \nSecurity Interest (SARFAESI) Act 2002 is proposed to be reduced from ` 500 26 \n \n \n \ncrore to asset size of ` 100 crore  or  loan size from existing ` 1 crore to ` 50 \nlakh. \n95. In the last few years, the government has taken concrete steps to \nbring our banking system to be robust.  However, there is a need for greater \nprivate capital. Accordingly, it is proposed to sell the balance holding of \nGovernment of India IDBI Bank to private, retail and institution al investors \nthrough the stock exchange.  \n96. There is a need to take further steps to bring in transparency and \ngreater professionalism in Public Sector Banks. The government  will take \nappropriate measures.  \n97. To help easy mobility while in jobs, we wish to infuse into the \nUniversal Pension coverage with auto enrolment; also, we wish to place \nsuch mechanisms which can enable inter-operability and provide safeguards \nfor the accumulated corpus.  \nRegulating role of  PFRDAI requires strengthening. Necessary \namendments would be carried out in Pension Fund Regulatory \nDevelopment Authority of India Act that will also facilitate separation of \nNPS trust for government employees from PFRDAI.   This would also enable \nestablishment of a Pension Trust by the employees other than Government. \nI am confident that this will motivate citizens to plan for their old age. \n98. MSMEs are vital to keep the wheels of economy moving. They also \ncreate job, innovate and are risk takers. Several measures for the MSMEs \nhave been taken in the past few years. There are more steps proposed in \nthis budget also.  \n98(1).  I propose to make necessary amendments to the Factor Regulation \nAct 2011. This will enable NBFCs to extend invoice financing to the MSMEs \nthrough TReDS, thereby enhancing their economic and financial \nsustainability.  \n98(2). Working capital credit remains a  major issue for the MSMEs.  It is \nproposed to introduce a scheme to provide subordinate debt for \nentrepreneurs of MSMEs.  This subordinate debt to be provided by banks \nwould co unt as quasi -equity and would be fully guaranteed through the 27 \n \n \n \nCredit Guarantee Trust for Medium and Small Entrepreneurs (CGTMSE). The \ncorpus of the CGTMSE would accordingly be augmented by the \ngovernment.  \n98(3). More than five lakh MSMEs have benefitted from restructuring of \ndebt permitted by RBI in the last year.  The restructuring window was to \nend on March 31, 2020. Government has asked RBI to consider extending \nthis window till March 31, 2021.  \n98(4). An app-based invoice financing loans product will be launched. This \nwill obviate the problem of delayed payments and consequential cash flows \nmismatches for the MSMEs.  \n99. Many mid -size companies are successful domestically but not in \nexport markets.  For selected sectors such as pharmaceuticals, auto \ncomponents and others, we pro pose to extend handholding support \u2013 for \ntechnology upgradations, R&D, business strategy etc. A scheme of ` 1000 \ncrore will be anchored by EXIM Bank together with SIDBI. Both these \ninstitutions would contribute ` 50 crore each.  This ` 100 crore would be \nachieved towards equity and technical assistance. Debt funding of `900 \ncrore from banks would be made available.  \nFinancial Markets  \n100. Last year, in the budget speech, I had mentioned about deepening \nthe bond market. To achieve the aspirational growth rate, we would require \nflow of capital in our financial system. A lot of work has been done on this in \nconsultation with the RBI. \nHon\u2019ble Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform this House o f the \ndevelopments:  \n100 (1). Certain specified categories of Government securities would be \nopened fully for non -resident investors, apart from being available to \ndomestic investors as well.  \n100 (2).  The limit for FPI in corporate bonds, currently at 9% of outstanding \nstock, will be increased to 15% of the outstanding stock of corporate bonds.  28 \n \n \n \n100(3). To improve investors\u2019 confidence and to expand the scope of credit \ndefault swaps, we propose to formulate a legislation , to be placed soon \nbefore the House, for laying down a mechanism for netting of financial \ncontracts.  \n101. The Debt-based Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) recently floated by the \ngovernment was a big success.  Government proposes to expand this by \nfloating a new Debt-ETF consisting primarily of government securities.  \nThis will give retai l investors access to government securities as \nmuch as giving an attractive investment for pension funds  and long-term \ninvestors.  \n102. To address the liquidity constraints of the NBFCs/HFCs, post the \nUnion budget 2019 -20, the government formulated a Partial Credit \nGuarantee scheme for the NBFCs. To further this support of providing \nliquidity, a mechanism would be devised . Government will offer support by \nguaranteeing securities so floated.  \nInfrastructure Financing \n103. Government\u2019s commitment for investment in infrastructure was \nreiterated when `103 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline projects \nwere announced. I would also like to inform that about ` 22,000 crore  has \nalready been provided , as support to Infrastructure Pipeline . This would \ncater for equity support to Infrastructure Finance Companies  such as IIFCL \nand  a subsidiary of NIIF.  They would leverage i t, as permissible, to create \nfinancing pipeline of more than `1,00,000 crore. This would create a major \nsource of long term debt for infrastructure projects and fulfil a  long \nawaited requirement. \n104. IFSC, GIFT city has the potential to become a centre o f international \nfinance as well as a centre for high end data processing: \n104 (1). GIFT IFSC has an approved Free Trade zone for housing  vault s. It \nalready has 19 insurance entities, 40 banking entities. It has also provided \nfor setting up of precious metals testing laboratories and refining facilities. \nWith the approval of the regulator, GIFT City would set up an International \nBullion exchange(s) in GIFT -IFSC as an additional option for trade by global 29 \n \n \n \nmarket participants.  This will enable India to enhance its position \nworldwide, create jobs in India and will lead to better price discovery of \ngold.   \n104 (2). In recent years there has been a surge in tradin g volumes of Indian \nrupee in the offshore financial centres. The Government and RBI has taken \nvarious measures to permit Rupee derivatives to be traded in the \nInternational Financial Services Centre at GIFT city, Gujarat.   \nDisinvestment \n105.  Listing of companies on stock exchanges discipline a company and \nprovides access to financial markets and unlocks its value.  It also gives \nopportunity for retail investors to participate in the wealth so created. The \ngovernment now proposes to sell a part of its  holding in LIC by way of Initial \nPublic Offer (IPO).  \nFiscal Management \n106. XV Finance Commission has given its first report pertaining to \nFinancial Year 2020 -21.  In the spirit of co -operative federalism, I am \npleased to announce that we have , in substa ntial measure,  accepted the \nrecommendations of the Commission. The commission would submit its \nfinal report to the President during the latter part of the  year, for five years \nbeginning 2021-22.  \n106. It is decided to transfer to the GST Compensation Fund balances due \nout of collection of the years 2016 -17 and 2017 -18, in two instalments . \nHereinafter, transfers to the fund would be limited only to collection by way \nof GST compensation cess. \n107.  A fundamental overhaul of Centrally Sponsored Schemes and \nCentral Sector Schemes is necessary, to align them with emerging social and \neconomic needs of tomorrow, and to ensure that scarce public resources \nare spent optimally.  \n108. Recently there has been a debate over transparency and credibility \nof the projected fiscal numbers. Let me assure the House that the 30 \n \n \n \nprocedure adopted is compliant with the FRBM Act .  This is also consistent \nwith the practices hitherto followed.  \nHowever, for greater clarity, I have enumerated those central \nGovernment debt that are not part of market borrowing and are used to \nfund the expenditure at the annexes.  Servicing of interest and repayment \nof these debts as hitherto, are done out of Consolidated fund of India. \n109. Revised Estimates of Expenditure for the Financial Year 2019 -20 are \nat a level of ` 26.99 lakh Crore and the receipts are estimated at `19.32 lakh \ncrore. \nWe have estimated nominal growth of GDP for year 2020 -21, on the \nbasis of trends available, at 10%. Accordingly, receipts for the year 2020 -21 \nare estimated at ` 22.46 lakh cr and, keeping in mind commitment of the \nGovernment towards various schemes and need for improvement in quality \nof life, level of expenditure has been kept at ` 30.42 lakh crore.  \nDuring the year Government has unfailingly worked towards keeping \nup the capital expenditure. Actually, there is substantial enhancement. All \nthe flagship schemes of the government have been fully provided  for. \nDetails may be seen at the annexes to the printed copy of my speech. \n110. Every budget must appropriately address the issue of fiscal deficit. \nRecently Government has undertaken very significant tax reforms for \nboosting investments. However, expected tax buoyancy will take time.  \nWe estimate a fiscal deficit of 3.8 % in RE  2019-20 and  3.5% for  \nBE 2020 -21.  This estimation is consistent with Government\u2019s abiding \ncommitment to macroeconomic stability.  It comprises of, \n(a) 3.3% for year 2019-20, and 3% for the 2020-21 budget estimate; \n(b) Section 4 (2) of the FRBM Act provides for a trigger mechanism for \na deviation from the estimated fiscal deficit on account of structural \nreforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal implications. \nTherefore, I have taken a deviation of 0.5%, consistent  with Section \n4(3) of FRBM Act, both for RE 2019-20 and BE 2020-21.  31 \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the return path is being laid before the parliament as a \npart of Medium Term Fiscal Policy  cum Strategy Statement. This fiscal \npath commits us to the path of fiscal consolid ation without \ncompromising the needs of investment out of public funds. \nAccordingly, net market borrowings for the year 2019 -20 would be  \n` 4.99 lakh crore and for the year 2020-21, it would be ` 5.36  lakh  crore. \n111.  A good part of the borrowings for t he financial year 2020 -21 would \ngo towards Capital expenditure of the Government that has been scaled up \nby  more than 21 %. As, I had previously mentioned another about ` 22,000 \ncrore have been allocated for equity to fund certain specified infrastructure \nfinance companies, who would leverage it manifold and provide much \nneeded long-term finance to Infrastructure sector. That should spur growth \nimpulses in the economy.  \nI would, now, move to Part B of my speech. \n 32 \n \nPART B  \nDirect Tax \n112. Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government has spearheaded radical fiscal \nmeasures to ensure that India\u2019s economy continues to tread the path of \nhigh growth. These are times when countries are competing with each \nother like never before to become the most attractive destination for doing \nbusiness. Therefore, to make sure that India stays globally competitive and \na favoured destination for  investment, we took a bold  historic decision of \nreducing the corporate tax rate for new companies in t he manufacturing \nsector to an unprecedented level of 15%. Similarly, for the existing \ncompanies, the rate has also been brought down to just 22%. As a result, \nour corporate tax rates are now amongst the lowest in the world. This will \nenable companies to ex pand their businesses and make fresh investments \nin the coming future. Though we will have loss of substantial revenue due to \nthese measures in the short -run, I am certain that our economy will reap \nhuge returns on this score in due course.  \n\u016e\u091c\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u0947\u0935\u092d\u0942\u0211\u0925\u014d\u0938\u0924\u093e\u0277\u094b\u092c\u093f\u0932\u092e\u0164\u0939\u0940\u0924\u094d\u0964 \n\u0938\u0939\u0177\u0917\u0941\u0923\u092e\u0941\u031d\u0177\u033d\u091f\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0926\u0205\u0947\u093f\u0939\u0930\u0938\u0902\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0903\u0965 \nSurya, the Sun, collects vapour from little drops of water.

In continuation of the reform measures already taken so far, the tax \nproposals in this budget will introduce further reforms to stimulate growth, \nsimplify tax structure, bring ease of compliance, and reduce litigations. \n114. Personal Income Tax  and simplification of taxation  \n\uf0b7 In the interim Budget of 2019, our government exempted  \nindividuals having income up to ` 5 Lakh from paying any income \ntax. Presently,  an individual pays 20% on income between ` 5 Lakh \nto ` 10 Lakh and 30% on income above ` 10 Lakh.   Further, \ncurrently the Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and \ndeductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and \nadministration of the Income Tax Act  by the tax authorities a 33 \n \nburdensome process. It is almost impossible for a ta xpayer to \ncomply with the Income -tax law without taking help from \nprofessionals.   \n\uf0b7 In order to provide significant relief to the individual taxpayers and \nto simplify the Income -tax law, I propose to  bring a  new and \nsimplified personal income tax regime w herein income tax rates will \nbe significantly reduced for the individual taxpayers who  forgo  \ncertain deductions and exemptions.  \n\uf0b7 Under the new regime, an individual shall be required to pay tax at \nthe  reduced rate  of  10% for income between ` 5 Lakh to  ` 7. 5 \nLakh  against the current rate of 20%.   \n\uf0b7 For income between ` 7.5 Lakh to ` 10 Lakh he will pay at the \nreduced  rate of  15%  against  the current rate of 20 %.   \n\uf0b7 Similarly for the income between ` 10 Lakh to ` 12.5 Lakh  the \ntaxpayer  will pay at the reduced rate of 20% against the current rate \nof 30 %.   \n\uf0b7 The income  between ` 12.5 Lakh to ` 15 Lakh  will be taxed  at the \nreduced rate of 25% against the existing rate of 30 %.  Incomes \nabove ` 15 lakh will be  continued to be taxed at the rate of 30 %.  \n\uf0b7 Those earning up to ` 5 lakhs shall not pay any tax either in the old \nregime or in  the new regime.  \n\uf0b7 The proposed tax structure will provide significant relief to  \ntaxpayers and more so to those in the middle class.  \nTaxable Income \nSlab (`) \nExisting Tax \nRates \nNew Tax Rates \n0-2.5 Lakh Exempt Exempt \n2.5-5 Lakh 5% 5% \n5-7.5 Lakh 20% 10% \n7.5-10 Lakh 20% 15% \n10-12.5 Lakh 30% 20% \n12.5-15 Lakh 30% 25% \nAbove 15 Lakh 30% 30% 34 \n \n\uf0b7 In the new tax regime, substantial tax benefit will accrue  to a \ntaxpayer depending upon exemptions and deductions claimed by \nhim.  For example, a person  earning ` 15 lakh  in a year and  not \navailing any deductions etc. will  pay only  `, 1,95,000 as compared \nto `, 2,73,000 in the old regime. Thus his tax burden shall be \nreduced by 78,000 in the new regime.  He would still  be  the gainer \nin the new regime even if he was taking  deduction of ` 1.5 Lakh \nunder  various sections of Chapter- VI-A of the Income Tax Act under \nthe old regime.   \n\uf0b7 The new tax regime shall be optional for the taxpayers. An individual \nwho is currently availing more deductions & exemption under the \nIncome Tax Act may choose to avail them and continue to pay tax in \nthe old regime.  \n\uf0b7 The new personal  income tax  rates will entail  estimated revenue  \nforgone of ` 40,000 crore per year.  We have also initiated measures \nto prefill the income tax return so that  an individual who opts for \nthe new regime would need no assistan ce from an expert to file his \nreturn and pay  income tax.  \n\uf0b7 In order to simplify income tax system, I  have reviewed all the \nexemptions and deductions which got incorporated in the income tax \nlegislation over the past several decades. It was surprising to k now \nthat currently more than one  hundred exemptions and deductions of \ndifferent nature are provided in the Income -tax Act.   I have removed \naround  70 of  them in the  new simplified regime.   We will  review  \nand rationalise the remaining  exemptions and  deductions in the \ncoming years  with  a view to  further simplifying the tax system and  \nlowering the tax rate.  \n115. Dividend Distribution Tax  \n\uf0b7 Currently, companies are required to pay Dividend Distribution Tax \n(DDT) on the dividend paid to its sharehold ers at the rate of 15% \nplus applicable surcharge and cess in addition to the tax payable by \nthe company on its profits.  \n\uf0b7 It has been argued that the system of levying DDT results in  increase \nin  tax burden for  investors  and especially those who are liab le to 35 \n \npay tax less than the rate of DDT if the dividend income is included \nin their income.  \n\uf0b7 Further, non -availability of credit of DDT to most of the foreign \ninvestors in their home country results in reduction of rate of return \non equity capital for  them. In order to increase the attractiveness of \nthe Indian Equity Market and to  provide relief to  a large class of \ninvestors, I propose to remove the DDT and adopt the classical \nsystem of dividend taxation under which the companies would not \nbe required to  pay DDT. The dividend shall be taxed only in the \nhands of the recipients at their applicable rate.  \n\uf0b7 Further, in order to remove the cascading effect, I also propose to \nallow deduction for the dividend received by holding company from \nits subsidiary.  The removal of DDT will lead to estimated annual \nrevenue forgone of ` 25,000 Crore. \n\uf0b7  This  is another bol d  move which will further make India an \nattractive destination for investment. \n116. Concessional tax rate for Electricity generation companies  \n\uf0b7 In order to give boost to the manufacturing sector, new provisions \nwere introduced  in September 2019 offering a concessional \ncorporate tax rate of 15% to the newly incorporated domestic \ncompanies in the manufacturing sector which start manufacturing \nby 31st March, 2023.  \n\uf0b7 In order to attract investment in  power sector, I propose to extend \nthe concessional corporat e tax rate of 15% to new domestic \ncompanies  engaged in the generation of electricity. \n117. Tax concession for foreign investments \n\uf0b7 In order to incentivise the investment by the Sovereign Wealth Fund \nof  foreign governments  in the priority sectors, I propo se to grant \n100% tax exemption to their  interest, dividend and capital gains \nincome  in respect of investment made in infrastructure  and other 36 \n \nnotified sectors  before 31 st March, 2024 and with a minimum lock -\nin period of 3 years.  \n\uf0b7 In order to make available foreign funds at a lower cost, I propose to \nextend the period of concessional withholding rate of 5% under \nsection 194LC for interest payment to non -residents in respect of \nmoneys borrowed and bonds issued up to 30th June, 2023.  \n\uf0b7 I  also propose to ex tend the period up to 30 th June, 2023 for lower \nrate of withholding of 5% under section 194LD for interest payment \nto  Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and  Qualified Foreign Investors \n(QFIs) in respect of bonds issued by Indian companies and \ngovernment securities.  \n\uf0b7 I further propose to extend the concessional rate of withholding of \n5% under section 194LD to the interest payment made on the \nMunicipal Bonds. \n\uf0b7 In order to incentivise listing of bonds at IFSC exchange, I propose to  \nfurther reduce the withhol ding rate from 5% to 4% on interest \npayment on the bonds listed on  its exchange.  \n118. Start-ups \nStart-ups have emerged as engines of growth for our economy. Over \nthe past year, our Government has taken several measures to hand -\nhold them and support their  growth. During their formative years, \nStart-ups generally use Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) to  \nattract  and retain  highly talented employees. ESOP is a significant \ncomponent of compensation for these employees. Currently, ESOPs \nare taxable as perquisites at the time of exercise. This leads to cash -\nflow problem for the employees who do not sell the shares \nimmediately and continue to hold the same for the long -term. In \norder to give a boost to the start -up ecosystem, I propose to ease \nthe burden of tax ation on the employees by deferring the tax \npayment  by five years or till they leave the company or  when they \nsell their shares, whichever is earliest.   37 \n \n\uf0b7 Further, an eligible Start -up having turnover up to 25 crores is \nallowed  deduction of 100% of its th e profits for three consecutive \nassessment years out of seven years if the total turnover  does not \nexceed 25 crore rupees. In order to extend this benefit to larger \nstart-ups, I propose to increase the turnover limit from existing ` 25 \ncrore to ` 100 crores. Moreover, considering the fact that in the \ninitial years, a start -up may not have adequate profit to avail this \ndeduction, I propose to extend the period of eligibility for claim of \ndeduction from the existing 7 years to 10 years. \n119. Concessional tax rate for Co-operatives \n\uf0b7 Co-operative societies play an extremely important role in our \neconomy in facilitating access to credit, procurement of inputs and \nmarketing of products to their members. These cooperatives are \ncurrently taxed at a rate of 30% with surcharge and cess. As a major \nconcession and in order to bring parity between the co -operative \nsocieties and corporate s, I propose to provide an option to \ncooperative societies to be taxed at 22% plus 10% surcharge and 4% \ncess with no exemption/d eductions. Further, I also propose to \nexempt these co -operative societies from Alternative Minimum Tax \n(AMT) just like companies under the new tax regime are exempted \nfrom the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT). \n120. Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSME) \n\uf0b7 Currently, businesses having turnover of more than one crore \nrupees are required to get their books of accounts audited by an \naccountant. In order to reduce the compliance burden on small \nretailers, traders, shopkeepers who comprise the  MSME sector, I \npropose to raise by five times  the turnover threshold for audit from  \nthe existing ` 1 crore to ` 5 crore. Further, in order to boost less \ncash economy, I propose that the increased limit shall apply  only to \nthose businesses which carry out less than 5% of the ir business \ntransactions in cash.      \n121. Affordable housing  \n\uf0b7 For realisation of the goal of \u2018Housing for All\u2019 and affordable \nhousing, in the last budget I had announced an additional deduction 38 \n \nof up to one lakh fifty thousand rupees for interest paid on  loans \ntaken for purchase of an affordable house. The deduction was \nallowed on housing loans sanctioned on or before 31st March, 2020. \nIn order to ensure that more persons avail this benefit and to further \nincentivise the affordable housing, I propose to e xtend the date of \nloan sanction  for availing this additional deduction by one more \nyear.   \n\uf0b7 Further, in order to boost the supply of affordable houses in the \ncountry, a tax holiday is provided on the profits earned by \ndevelopers of affordable housing proje ct approved by 31 st March, \n2020. In order to promote the affordable housing projects, I propose \nto extend the date of approval of affordable housing projects for \navailing this tax holiday by one more year.    \n122. Concession to real estate transactions \n\uf0b7 Currently, while taxing income from capital gains, business profits \nand other sources in respect of transactions in real estate, if the \nconsideration  value is less than  circle rate by more than 5 percent, \nthe difference  is counted as income both in the hands of the \npurchaser and seller.   In order to minimize hardship in real estate \ntransaction and provide  relief to the sector, I propose to increase \nthe limit of 5% to 10%.   \n123.  Charity institutions  \n\uf0b7 Acknowledging the important role played by the char itable \ninstitutions in the society, the income of these institutions is fully \nexempt from taxation. Further, donation made to these institutions \nis also allowed as deduction in computing the taxable income of the \ndonor.  \n\uf0b7 Currently, a taxpayer is required to fill the complete details of the \ndonee  in the  income tax return for availing deduction.    \n\uf0b7 In order to ease the process of claiming deduction for donation, it is \nproposed to pre -fill the donee\u2019s information in taxpaye r\u2019s return on \nthe basis of information of donations furnished by the donee. This 39 \n \nwould result in hassle-free claim of deduction for the donation made \nby the taxpayer.   \n\uf0b7 Further, in order to claim the tax exemption, the charity institutions \nhave to be regis tered with the Income T ax Department. In the past, \nthe process of the registration was completely manual and scattered \nall over the country.   \n\uf0b7 In order to simplify the compliance for the new and existing charity \ninstitutions, I propose to make the process of registration \ncompletely electronic under which a unique registration number \n(URN)  shall be issued to all new and existing charity institutions. \nFurther, to facilitate the registration of the new charity institution \nwhich is yet to start their charitabl e activities, I propose to allow \nthem provisional registration for three years.     \n124.  Faceless appeals \nOur government is committed to bring ing in transformational \nchanges so that maximum governance is provided with minimum \ngovernment. In order to impar t greater efficiency, transparency and \naccountability to the assessment process, a new faceless assessment \nscheme has already been introduced. Currently, most of the functions of \nthe Income Tax Department starting from the filing of return, processing of \nreturns, issuance of refunds and assessment are performed in the electronic \nmode without any human interface.  In order  to take the reforms initiated \nby the Department to the next level and to eliminate human interface, I \npropose to amend the Income Tax Act so as to enable Faceless appeal on \nthe lines of Faceless assessment.  \n125.  No Dispute but Trust Scheme \u2013 \u2018Vivad  Se Vishwas\u2019Scheme \n\uf0b7 Sir, in the past our Government has taken several measures to \nreduce tax litigations. In the last budget, Sabka Vishwas Scheme was \nbrought in to reduce litigation in indirect taxes. It  resulted in settling  \nover 1,89,000  cases. Currently, there are 4,83,000 direct tax cases \npending in various appellate forums i.e. Commissioner (Appeals), \nITAT, High Court and Supreme Court . This year, I propose to bring a \nscheme similar to the indirect tax Sabka Vishwas  for reducing  \nlitigations even in  the direct taxes.   40 \n \n\uf0b7 Under the proposed \u2018Vivad Se Vishwas\u2019 scheme, a taxpayer would \nbe required to pay only the amount of the disputed tax es and will \nget complete waiver of interest and penalty provided he pays by 31 st \nMarch, 2020.  Those who avail this scheme after 31 st March, 2020 \nwill have to pay some additional amount. The scheme will remain \nopen  till 30th June, 2020.  \n\uf0b7 Taxpayers in whos e cases appeals are pending at any level can \nbenefit from this scheme.  \n\uf0b7  I hope that taxpayers will make use of this opportunity to get relief \nfrom vexatious litigation process.  \n126.  Losses of merged banks \n\uf0b7 As a part of consolidation of the financial sector, our Government \nhas brought out schemes for merger and amalgamation of public \nsector banks.  In order to ensure that the amalgamated entities are \nable to take the benefit of unabsorbed losses and depreciation of \nthe amalgamating entities, I propose to make necessary \namendments to the provisions of the Income-tax Act. \n127.  Taxpayer\u2019s Charter \n\uf0b7 Any tax system requires trust between taxpayers and the \nadministration. This will be possible  only when  taxpayer\u2019s rights are \nclearly enumerated. Towards this end, and with the objective of \nenhancing the efficiency of the delivery system of the Income Tax \nDepartment, I propose to amend the provisions of the Income  Tax \nAct to mandate the  Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to adopt a \nTaxpayers\u2019 Charter. The details of the contents of the charter shall \nbe notified soon. \n128. Instant PAN through Aadhaar \n\uf0b7 In the last Budget, I had introduced the interchangeability of PAN \nand Aadhaar for which necessary rules were already notified. In \norder to further ease the proces s of allotment of PAN, soon we will \nlaunch a system under which PAN shall be instantly allotted online \non the basis of Aadhaar without any requirement for filling up of \ndetailed application form.  41 \n \n129. Our Government brought in  the GST  as a historic reform of the  \nindirect taxes in 2017. We also took a  path-breaking step of simplifying and \nrationalising corporate tax i n September, 2019.  More importantly, we \noffered  a rate of corporate  tax, which perhaps is the lowest in the world.  \nContinuing on this path,  we have now put the personal income tax at its \nlowest ever rate and totally removed DDT at the company\u2019s hands. Further, \nthe direct taxes are now the lowest, simplest, and smoothest. Direct tax  on \nthe Start -ups also has seen  many reformatory  st eps in quick succession. \nEven ease of compliance is seeing unprecedented changes. Last but not the \nleast,  personal interface with tax administration is at the minimum ever.   \nIndirect Tax \n130. As I mentioned earlier in Part A of my speech,  reforms are \ncontinuing in GST. A simplified return shall be implemented from the 1 st \nApril, 2020. This is under pilot run. It will make return filing simple with \nfeatures like SMS based filing for nil return, return pre -filling, improved \ninput tax credit flow and overall simplification. \n131. Refund process has been simplified and has been made fully \nautomated with no human interface. \n132. Electronic invoice is another innovation wherein critical information \nshall be captured electronically in a centralized system. It will be \nimplemented in a phased manner starting from this month itself on optional \nbasis. It will facilitate compliance and return filing. \n133. Several measures have been taken for improving compliance.  \nAadhaar based verification of taxpayers is being int roduced. This will help in \nweeding out dummy or non -existent units.   Dynamic QR -code is proposed  \nfor consumer invoices. GST parameters will be captured when payment for  \npurchases is made through the QR -code. A system of cash reward is \nenvisaged to incentivise customers to seek invoice.  Deep data analytics and \nAI tools are being used for crackdown on GST input tax credit, refund, and \nother frauds and to identify all those who are trying to game the system. \nInvoice  and input tax credit matching is  being  done wherein returns having \nmismatch more than 10 percent  or above a threshold are identified and \npursued. Significant policy level changes have also been made. GST rate \nstructure is also being deliberated  so as to address issues like inverted duty \nstructure.    42 \n \n134. On Customs side, a number of measures have been taken for ease of \ndoing business.  India\u2019s quantum leap in the Trading Across Border \nparameter of Ease of Doing Business rankings by the World Bank is a \ntestimony to these efforts. India\u2019s rank  on this parameter improved from \n146 to 80 in 2018 and further to 68 in 2019.  Measures have also been  \ntaken for providing a level playing field to our domestic manufacturers, \nparticularly the MSME sector and for securing borders. \n135. It has been observe d that imports under Free Trade Agreements \n(FTAs) are on the rise. Undue claims of FTA benefits have posed threat to \ndomestic industry. Such imports require stringent checks. In this context, \nsuitable provisions are being incorporated in the Customs Act. I n the \ncoming months we shall review Rules of Origin requirements, particularly \nfor certain sensitive items, so as ensure that FTAs are aligned to the \nconscious  direction of our policy. \n136. We are also strengthening provisions relating to safeguard duties  \nwhich are applied when surge in imports causes serious injury to domestic \nindustry. Amended provisions shall enable regulating such surge in imports \nin a systematic way.  The provisions for checking  dumping of goods and \nimports of subsidized goods are also being strengthened for ensuring a level \nplaying field for domestic industry.  These changes are in line with the  \ninternational best practices. \n137. Exemptions from customs duty have been given in public interest \nfrom time to time. However, a number of these have outlived their utility or \nhave become outdated. On review, certain such exemptions are being \nwithdrawn. Remaining custom duty exemptions shall be comprehensively \nreviewed by September, 2020 for taking a view on their relevance. I \npropose to crow d source suggestions for such reviews. Suggestions would \nalso be invited in respect of the Customs laws and procedures for   aligning \nthem with the needs of changing times and ease of doing business. \n138. Labour intensive sectors in MSME are critical for e mployment \ngeneration. Cheap and low -quality imports are an impediment  to their \ngrowth. Special attention has been taken to put measured restraint on \nimport of those items which are being produced by our MSMEs with better \nquality.   Keeping in view the nee d of this sector, customs duty is being \nraised on items like footwear and furniture. \n139. Our policy of Make in India has started giving dividends. India is now \nmaking world class goods and exporting such products. We have made \nconsiderable progress in med ical equipment too. Till few years back we 43 \n \nwere dependent on imports for medical equipment.  Now, not only we are \nmanufacturing medical equipment but also exporting them in large \nquantities. This sector deserves further fillip. Government has also been \ncommitted to provide health services to all. Ayushman Bharat has made it \npossible. To achieve the twin objectives of giving impetus to the domestic \nindustry and also to generate resource for health services, I propose to \nimpose a nominal health cess, by way o f a duty of customs, on the imports \nof medical equipment keeping in view that these goods are now being \nmade significantly in India. The proceed from this cess shall be used for \ncreating infrastructure for health services in the aspirational districts.      \n140. Under Make in India initiative, well laid out customs duty rates were \npre-announced for items like mobile phones, electric vehicles and their \ncomponents.  This has ensured gradual increase in domestic value addition \ncapacity in India. Customs duty r ates are being revised on electric vehicles, \nand parts of mobiles as part of such carefully conceived Phased \nManufacturing Plans.  \n141. In other changes, customs duty is being reduced on certain inputs \nand raw materials while it is being revised upward on certain goods which \nare being made domestically.  In the previous budget, basic custom duty  of \n10% was imposed on the news print and lightweight coated paper . \nHowever, since then I have received several references that this levy has \nput additional burden on print media at a time when it is going through a \ndifficult phase. I, therefore, propose to reduce basic customs duty on \nimports of news print and light-weight coated paper from 10% to 5%.   \n142. Chemicals are crucial feed stocks for downstream users. PT A, for \nexample, is a critical input for textile fibres and yarns.  Its easy availability at \ncompetitive prices is desirable to unlock immense potential in textile sector \nwhich is a significant employment generator.  Therefore, in the larger  \npublic interest, anti-dumping duty on PTA is being abolished. \n143.  As a revenue measure, I propose to raise excise duty, by way of \nNational Calamity Contingent Duty on Cigarettes and other tobacco \nproducts. However, no change is being made in the duty rates of bidis. \n144.  Finally, continuing the tax reform is an ongoing challenge and we \npropose to pursue them with full vigour. \n145.
