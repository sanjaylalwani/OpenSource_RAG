    "content": "4\n(i) A roof for each family in India.  The call given for \u2018Housing for\nall\u2019 by 2022 would require Team India to complete 2 crore houses\nin urban areas and 4 crore houses in rural areas.\n(ii) Each house in the country should have basic facilities of 24-hour\npower supply, clean drinking water, a toilet, and be connected to\na road.\n(iii) At least one member from each family should have access to the\nmeans for livelihood and, employment or economic opportunity,\nto improve his or her lot.\n(iv) Substantial reduction of poverty.  All our schemes should focus\non and centre around the poor. Each of us has to commit ourselves\nto this task of eliminating absolute poverty.\n(v) Electrification, by 2020, of the remaining 20,000 villages in the\ncountry, including by off-grid solar power generation.\n(vi) Connecting each of the 1,78,000 unconnected habitations by all\nweather roads.  This will require completing 1,00,000 km of roads\ncurrently under construction plus sanctioning and building another\n1,00,000 km of road.\n(vii) Good health is a necessity for both quality of life, and a person\u2019s\nproductivity and ability to support his or her family.  Providing\nmedical services in each village and city is absolutely essential.\n(viii) Educating and skilling our youth to enable them to get employment\nis the altar before which we must all bow.  To ensure that there is\na senior secondary school within 5 km reach of each child, we\nneed to upgrade over 80,000 secondary schools and add or upgrade\n75,000 junior/middle, to the senior secondary level.  We also have\nto ensure that education improves in terms of quality and learning\noutcomes.\n(ix) Increase in agricultural productivity and realization of reasonable\nprices for agricultural production is essential for the welfare of\nrural areas.  We should commit to increasing the irrigated area,\nimproving the efficiency of existing irrigation systems, promoting\nagro-based industry for value addition and increasing farm\nincomes, and reasonable prices for farm produce.\n(x) In terms of communication, the rural and urban divide should no\nlonger be acceptable to us.  We have to ensure connectivity to all\nthe villages without it.5\n(xi) Two-thirds of our population is below 35.  To ensure that our\nyoung get proper jobs, we have to aim to make India the\nmanufacturing hub of the world.  The Skill India and the Make in\nIndia programmes are aimed at doing this.\n(xii) We also have to encourage and grow the spirit of entrepreneurship\nin India and support new start-ups.  Thus can our youth turn from\nbeing job-seekers, to job-creators.\n(xiii) The Eastern and North Eastern regions of our country are lagging\nbehind in development on many fronts. We need to ensure that\nthey are on par with the rest of the country.\n17. By the time of the 75th year of Indian independence, Amrut Mahotsav of\nour independence is reached, we have to achieve all of the above, so that India\nbecomes a prosperous  country; and a responsible global power.  This will be our\ntrue and meaningful tribute to our freedom fighters.\nMajor Challenges Ahead\n18. As I stated earlier, Madam Speaker, I am also mindful of the five major\nchallenges I have to reckon with.  Firstly, Agricultural incomes are under stress.\nOur second challenge is increasing investment in infrastructure.  With private\ninvestment in infrastructure via the public private partnership (PPP) model still\nweak, public investment needs to step in, to catalyse investment.\n19. Our third major challenge is that manufacturing has declined from 18%\nto 17% of GDP as per new GDP data; and manufacturing exports have remained\nstagnant at about 10% of GDP.  The Make in India programme is aimed at meeting\nthis challenge, thus creating jobs.\n20. Fourth, we need to be mindful of the need for fiscal discipline in spite of\nrising demands for public investment. In keeping with the true spirit of co-\noperative federalism, we have devolved a 42% share of the divisible pool of\ntaxes to States.  As members of this august House are aware, this is an\nunprecedented increase which would empower states with more resources. The\ndevolution to the States would be of the order of `5.24 lakh crore in 2015-16 as\nagainst the devolution of `3.38 lakh crore as per revised estimates of 2014-15.\nAnother `3.04 lakh crore would be transferred by way of grants and plan transfers.\nThus, total transfer to the States will be about 62% of the total tax receipts of the\ncountry.\n21. In spite of the consequential reduced fiscal space for the Centre, the\nGovernment has decided to continue supporting important national priorities\nsuch as agriculture, education, health, MGNREGA, and rural infrastructure\nincluding roads.  Programmes targeted for the poor and the under-privileged,\nwill be continued by us.6\n22. With fiscal space not just reduced but squeezed, I have to meet the fifth\nchallenge of maintaining fiscal discipline.    Economic growth this year, at 11.5%,\nwas lower in nominal terms by about 2%, due to lower inflation.  Consequently,\ntax buoyancy was also significantly lower.  Despite this, Madam, I have kept my\nword, and we will meet the challenging fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP , that\nwe had inherited.  Madam Speaker, I need to overcome these challenges to reduce\nand eliminate poverty.\nFiscal Roadmap\n23. I want to underscore that my government still remains firm on achieving\nthe medium term target of 3% of GDP .  But that journey has to take account of\nthe need to increase public investment.  The total additional public investment\nover and above the RE is planned to be `1.25 lakh crore out of which `70,000\ncrore would be capital expenditure from budgetary outlays.  We also have to\ntake into account the drastically reduced fiscal space; uncertainties that\nimplementation of GST will create; and the likely burden from the report of the\n7th Pay Commission.  Rushing into, or insisting on, a pre-set time-table for\nfiscal consolidation pro-cyclically would, in my opinion, not be pro-growth.  With\nthe economy improving, the pressure for accelerated fiscal consolidation too has\ndecreased.  In these circumstances, I will complete the journey to a fiscal deficit\nof 3% in 3 years, rather than the two years envisaged previously.  Thus, for the\nnext three years, my targets are: 3.9%, for 2015-16; 3.5% for\n2016-17; and, 3.0% for 2017-18.  The additional fiscal space will go towards\nfunding infrastructure investment.\n24. I am moving amendments accordingly, in the Finance Bill, to the FRBM\nAct.\n25. Madam Speaker, I want to round up the discussion on the fiscal road\nmap on an optimistic note.  While there is a compositional shift, the aggregate\nenvelope for job creation, poverty elimination and building infrastructure is not\ndisturbed; in fact it goes up this year, and every subsequent year, in the same\nproportion as the tax revenues of the Union, and the State Governments increase.\nFrom this national perspective of public finances, not only is the path to fiscal\nconsolidation on track, aggregate annual capital expenditure of the Governments,\nas a whole, can be expected to rise  significantly, by more than 0.5% of GDP.\n26. Madam Speaker, it may be noted that the budget reflects considerable\nscaling up of disinvestment figures.  This will include both disinvestment in loss\nmaking units, and some strategic disinvestment.\nGood Governance\n27. Madam, Speaker, this Government is committed in its resolve, as Indians,\nto regain our pre-eminence as a just and compassionate country.  Well-intentioned7\nschemes  introduced in the past, have often been ill-targeted, riddled with leakages\nand delivered with inefficiency.  The same is true of subsidies.  Subsidies are\nneeded for the poor and those less well off. What we need is a well targeted\nsystem of subsidy delivery. We need to cut subsidy leakages, not subsidies\nthemselves.We are committed to the process of rationalizing subsidies based on\nthis approach.\n28. We have embarked on that path.  The direct transfer of benefits, started\nmostly in scholarship schemes, will be further expanded with a view to increasing\nthe number of beneficiaries from the present 1 crore to 10.3 crore.  Similarly,\n`6,335 crore have so far been transferred directly, as LPG subsidy to 11.5 crore\nLPG consumers.  I am sure, persons who are better-off, such as those in the top\ntax bracket, and those genuinely concerned for the welfare of the poor, such as\nmembers of this House, will give up their LPG subsidy voluntarily.\nAgriculture\n29. Our commitment to farmers runs deep.  We have already taken major\nsteps to address the two major factors critical to agricultural production: soil and\nwater.  An ambitious Soil Health Card Scheme has been launched to improve\nsoil fertility on a sustainable basis.  In order to improve soil health, I also propose\nto support Agiculture Ministry\u2019s organic farming scheme \u2013 \u201cParamparagat Krishi\nVikas Yojana\u201d.  The Pradhanmantri Gram Sinchai Yojana is aimed at irrigating\nthe field of every farmer and improving water use efficiency to provide `Per\nDrop More Crop\u2019.  I am allocating `5,300 crore to support micro-irrigation,\nwatershed development and the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana.  I urge\nthe States to chip in substantially in this vital sector.\n30. To support the agriculture sector with the help of effective and hassle-\nfree agriculture credit, with a special focus on small and marginal farmers,\nI propose to allocate `25,000 crore in 2015-16 to the corpus of Rural Infrastructure\nDevelopment Fund (RIDF) set up in NABARD; `15,000 crore for Long Term\nRural Credit Fund;  `45,000 crore for Short Term Cooperative Rural Credit\nRefinance Fund; and `15,000 crore for Short Term RRB Refinance Fund.\n31. Farm credit underpins the efforts of our hard-working farmers.  I have,\ntherefore, set up an ambitious target of `8.5 lakh crore of credit during the year\n2015-16 which, I am sure, the banks will surpass.\n32. Our government is committed to supporting employment through\nMGNREGA. We will ensure that no one who is poor is left without employment.\nWe will focus on improving the quality and effectiveness of activities under\nMGNREGA.  I have made an initial allocation of `34,699 crore for the\nprogramme.8\n33. While the farmer is no longer in the clutches of the local trader, his produce\nstill does not command the best national price. To increase the incomes of farmers,\nit is imperative that we create a National agricultural market, which will have\nthe incidental benefit of moderating price rises.  I intend this year to work with\nthe States, in NITI, for the creation of a Unified National Agriculture Market.\nFunding the Unfunded\n34. Madam Speaker, our government firmly believes that development\nhas to generate inclusive growth. While large corporate and business entities\nhave a role to play, this has to be complemented by informal sector enterprises\nwhich generate maximum employment. There are some 5.77 crore small business\nunits, mostly individual proprietorship, which run small manufacturing, trading\nor service businesses.  62% of these are owned by SC/ST/OBC.  These bottom-\nof-the-pyramid, hard-working entrepreneurs find it difficult, if not impossible,\nto access formal systems of credit.  I, therefore, propose to create a Micro Units\nDevelopment Refinance Agency (MUDRA) Bank,  with a corpus of `20,000\ncrore, and credit guarantee corpus of `3,000 crore.  MUDRA Bank will  refinance\nMicro-Finance Institutions through a Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. In lending,\npriority will be given to SC/ST enterprises. These measures will greatly increase\nthe confidence of young, educated or skilled workers who would now be able to\naspire to become first generation entrepreneurs; existing small businesses, too,\nwill be able to expand their activities. Just as we are banking the un-banked, we\nare also funding the un-funded.\n35. A significant part of the working capital requirement of a MSME arises\ndue to long receivables realization cycles.    We are in the process of establishing\nan electronic Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) financing of trade\nreceivables of MSMEs, from corporate and other buyers, through multiple\nfinanciers.  This should improve the liquidity in the MSME sector significantly.\n36. Bankruptcy law reform, that brings about legal certainty and speed, has\nbeen identified as a key priority for improving the ease of doing business.   SICA\n(Sick Industrial Companies Act) and BIFR (Bureau for Industrial and Financial\nReconstruction) have failed in achieving these objectives.  We will bring a\ncomprehensive Bankruptcy Code in fiscal 2015-16, that will meet global standards\nand provide necessary judicial capacity.\n37. The Government is committed to increasing access of the people to the\nformal financial system.  In this context, Government proposes to utilize the\nvast Postal network with nearly 1,54,000 points of presence spread across the\nvillages of the country.  I hope that the Postal Department will make its proposed\nPayments Bank venture successful so that it contributes further to the Pradhan\nMantri Jan Dhan Yojana.9\n38. To bring parity in regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies\n(NBFCs) with other financial institutions in matters relating to recovery, it is\nproposed that NBFCs registered with RBI and having asset size of `500 crore\nand above will be considered for notifications as \u2018Financial Institution\u2019 in terms\nof the SARFAESI Act, 2002.\nFrom Jan Dhan to Jan Suraksha\n39. A large proportion of India\u2019s population is without insurance of any kind\n- health, accidental or life.  Worryingly, as our young population ages, it is also\ngoing to be pension-less.  Encouraged by the success of the Pradhan Mantri Jan\nDhan Yojana, I propose to work towards creating a universal social security\nsystem for all Indians, specially the poor and the under-privileged.\n40. The soon-to-be-launched Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna will cover\naccidental death risk of `2 lakh for a premium of just `12 per year. Similarly, we\nwill also launch the Atal Pension Yojana, which will provide a defined pension,\ndepending on the contribution, and its period. To encourage people to join this\nscheme, the Government will contribute 50% of the beneficiaries\u2019 premium\nlimited to `1,000 each year, for five years, in the new accounts opened before\n31st December, 2015.\n41. The third Social Security Scheme that I wish to announce is the Pradhan\nMantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana which covers both natural and accidental death\nrisk of `2 lakhs.  The premium will be `330 per year, or less than one rupee per\nday, for the age group 18-50.\n42. There are unclaimed deposits of about `3,000 crore in the PPF, and\napproximately `6,000 crore in the EPF corpus.  I have proposed the creation of\na Senior Citizen Welfare Fund, in the Finance Bill, for appropriation of these\namounts to a corpus which will be used to subsidize the premiums of vulnerable\ngroups such as old age pensioners, BPL card-holders, small and marginal farmers\nand others. A detailed scheme would be issued in March.\n43. Madam Speaker, special regard needs to be paid to the population of\nsenior citizens in the country which is now approximately 10.5 crore, out of\nwhich over one crore are above the age of 80 years.  70% live in rural areas and\na large number are in the BPL category.  A sizeable percentage of them also\nsuffer from age related disabilities.  Ours is a society that venerates its elders.\nI, therefore, propose that a new scheme for providing Physical Aids and Assisted\nLiving Devices for senior citizens, living below the poverty line.\n44. In sum, these social security schemes reflect our commitment to utilize\nthe Jan Dhan platform, to ensure that no Indian citizen will have to worry about\nillness, accidents, or penury in old age. Being sensitive to the needs of the poor,\nunder-privileged and the disadvantaged, my Government also remains committed10\nto the ongoing welfare schemes for the SCs, STs and Women.  Despite serious\nconstraints on Union finances, allocations made this year are as follows:\nSC ` 30,851 crore\nST ` 19,980 crore\nWomen ` 79,258 crore\n45. An integrated education and livelihood scheme called \u2018Nai Manzil\u2019 will\nbe launched this year to enable Minority Youth who do not have a formal school-\nleaving certificate to obtain one and find better employment. Further, to show-\ncase civilization and culture of the Parsis, the Government will support, in\n2015-16, an exhibition, \u2018The Everlasting Flame\u2019.  The allocation for the Ministry\nof Minority Affairs is being protected. The BE for the year 2015-16 is `3,738\ncrore.\nInfrastructure\n46. Madam, it is no secret that the major slippage in the last decade has been\non the infrastructure front. Our infrastructure does not match our growth\nambitions.  There is a pressing need to increase public investment.  I have,\ntherefore, increased outlays on both the roads and the gross budgetary support to\nthe railways, by `14,031 crore, and `10,050 crore respectively.   The CAPEX of\nthe public sector units is expected to be ` 3,17,889 crore, an increase of\napproximately `80,844 crore over RE 2014-15. In fact, all told, investment in\ninfrastructure will go up by `70,000  crore in the year 2015-16, over the year\n2014-15 from the Centre\u2019s Funds and resources of CPSEs.\n47. Secondly, I intend to establish a National Investment and Infrastructure\nFund (NIIF), and find monies to ensure an annual flow of ` 20,000 crore to it.\nThis will enable the Trust to raise debt, and in turn, invest as equity, in\ninfrastructure finance companies such as the IRFC and NHB.  The infrastructure\nfinance companies can then leverage this extra equity, many fold.  Thirdly, I also\nintend to permit tax free infrastructure bonds for the projects in the rail, road and\nirrigation sectors.  Fourth, the PPP mode of infrastructure development has to be\nrevisited, and revitalised.  The major issue involved is rebalancing of risk. In\ninfrastructure projects, the sovereign will have to bear a major part of the risk\nwithout, of course, absorbing it entirely.\n48. Fifth, I also intend to establish, in NITI, the Atal Innovation Mission\n(AIM).   AIM will be an Innovation Promotion Platform involving academics,\nentrepreneurs, and researchers and draw upon national and international\nexperiences to foster a culture of innovation, R&D and scientific research in\nIndia. The platform will also promote a network of world-class innovation hubs\nand Grand Challenges for India.  Initially, a sum of ` 150 crore will be earmarked\nfor this purpose.11\n49. India has a well regarded and world-class IT industry with revenues of\nabout US$ 150 billion, over US$ 100 billion of exports, employing nearly 40\nlakh people directly.  We are now seeing a growing interest in start-ups.\nExperimenting in cutting edge technologies, creating value out of ideas and\ninitiatives and converting them into scalable enterprises and businesses is at the\ncore of our strategy for engaging our youth and for inclusive and sustainable\ngrowth of the country. Concerns such as a more liberal system of raising global\ncapital, incubation facilities in our Centres of Excellence, funding for seed capital\nand growth, and ease of Doing Business etc. need to be addressed to create lakh\nof jobs and hundreds of billion dollars in value.\n50. With this objective, Government is establishing a mechanism to be\nknown as SETU (Self-Employment and Talent Utilisation).  SETU will be a\nTechno-Financial, Incubation and Facilitation Programme to support all aspects\nof start-up businesses, and other self-employment activities, particularly in\ntechnology-driven areas. I am setting aside ` 1,000 crore initially in NITI Aayog\nfor this purpose.\n51. As the success of so-called minor ports has shown, ports can be an\nattractive investment possibility for the private sector.  Ports in the public sector\nneed to both attract such investment as well as leverage the huge land resources\nlying unused with them.  To enable us to do so, ports in public sector will be\nencouraged, to corporatize, and become companies under the Companies Act.\n52. Madam Speaker, investors spend a large amount of time and resources\non getting the multiple permissions required.  We aim towards ease of doing in\nIndia.  I have myself launched the e-Biz Portal which integrates 14 regulatory\npermissions at one source.  Good States are embracing and joining this platform.\nHowever, if we really want to create jobs, we have to make India an investment\ndestination which permits the start of a business in accordance with publically\nstated guidelines and criteria.\n53. I intend to appoint an Expert Committee for this purpose to examine the\npossibility and prepare a draft legislation where the need for multiple prior\npermissions can be replaced with a pre-existing regulatory mechanism.\n54. The Government also proposes to set up 5 new Ultra Mega Power Projects,\neach of 4000 MWs in the plug-and-play mode.  All clearances and linkages will\nbe in place before the project is awarded by a transparent auction system.  This\nshould unlock investments to the extent of ` 1 lakh crore.  The Government\nwould also consider similar plug-and-play projects in other infrastructure projects\nsuch as roads, ports, rail lines, airports etc. I am happy to announce that the\nsecond unit of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Station will be commissioned in\n2015-16.12\n55. Madam Speaker, I hope to garner some additional resources during the\nyear from tax buoyancy.  If I am successful, then over and above the budgetary\nallocation, I will endeavour to enhance allocations to MGNREGA by ` 5,000\ncrore; Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) by ` 1,500 crore; Integrated\nChild Protection Scheme (ICPS) by ` 500 crore; and the Prdhan Mantri Krishi\nSinchai Yojana by ` 3,000 crore; and the initial inflow of ` 5,000 crore into the\nNIIF.\nFinancial Markets\n56. One vital factor in promoting investment in India, including in the\ninfrastructure sector, is the deepening of the Indian Bond market, which we have\nto bring at the same level as our world class equity market.  I intend to begin this\nprocess this year by setting up a Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA)\nwhich will bring both India\u2019s external borrowings and domestic debt under one\nroof.\n57. I also propose to merge the Forwards Markets Commission with SEBI to\nstrengthen regulation of commodity forward markets and reduce wild speculation.\nEnabling legislation, amending the Government Securities Act and the RBI Act\nis proposed in the Finance Bill, 2015.\n58. Capital Account Controls is a policy, rather than a regulatory, matter.\nI, therefore, propose to amend, through the Finance Bill, Section-6 of FEMA to\nclearly provide that control on capital flows as equity will be exercised by the\nGovernment, in consultation with the RBI.\n59. A properly functioning capital market also requires proper consumer\nprotection.  I, therefore, also propose to create a Task Force to establish a sector-\nneutral Financial Redressal Agency that will address grievances against all\nfinancial service providers.  I am also glad to inform the House that work assigned\nto the Task Forces on the Financial Data Management Centre, the Financial\nSector Appellate Tribunal, the Resolution Corporation, and the Public Debt\nManagement Agency are progressing satisfactorily.  We have also received a\nlarge number of suggestions regarding the Indian Financial Code (IFC), which\nare currently being reviewed by the Justice Srikrishna Committee.  I hope, sooner\nrather than later, to introduce the IFC in Parliament for consideration.\n60. Madam, Speaker, this is just the beginning.  I have a vision of putting in\nplace a direct tax regime which is internationally competitive on rates, is without\nexemptions, incentivises savings, and does not realize tax from intermediaries.\nSuch a direct tax regime would match the modernized indirect taxes regime we\nare putting in place by way of GST, and will bring both greater transparency and\ngreater investments.13\n61. Madam Speaker the situation with regard to the dormant Employees\nProvident Fund (EPF) accounts and the claim ratios of ESIs is too well known to\nbe repeated here.  It has been remarked that both EPF and ESI have hostages,\nrather than clients.  Further, the low paid worker suffers deductions greater than\nthe better paid workers, in percentage terms.\n62. With respect to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), the employee needs\nto be provided two options. Firstly, the employee may opt for EPF or the New\nPension Scheme (NPS).  Secondly, for employees below a certain threshold of\nmonthly income, contribution to EPF should be optional, without affecting or\nreducing the employer\u2019s contribution. With respect to ESI, the employee should\nhave the option of choosing either ESI or a Health Insurance product, recognized\nby the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA). We intend to bring\namending legislation in this regard, after stakeholder consultation.\nMonetising Gold\n63. India is one of the largest consumers of gold in the world and imports as\nmuch as 800-1000 tonnes of gold each year.  Though stocks of gold in India are\nestimated to be over 20,000 tonnes, mostly this gold is neither traded, nor\nmonetized. I propose to:\n(i) Introduce a Gold Monetisation Scheme,  which will replace both\nthe present Gold Deposit and Gold metal Loan Schemes.  The new\nscheme will allow the depositors of gold to earn interest in their\nmetal accounts and the jewelers to obtain loans in their metal\naccount.  Banks/other dealers would also be able to monetize this\ngold.\n(ii) Also develop an alternate financial asset, a Sovereign Gold Bond,\nas an alternative to purchasing metal gold.  The Bonds will carry a\nfixed rate of interest, and also be redeemable in cash in terms of the\nface value of the gold, at the time of redemption by the holder of\nthe Bond.\n(iii) Commence work on developing an Indian Gold Coin, which will\ncarry the Ashok Chakra on its face.  Such an Indian Gold Coin\nwould help reduce the demand for coins minted outside India and\nalso help to recycle the gold available in the country.\n64. One way to curb the flow of black money is to discourage transactions in\ncash.  Now that a majority of Indians has or can have, a RUPAY debit card.  I,\ntherefore,  proposes to introduce soon several measures that will incentivize\ncredit or debit card transactions, and disincentivise cash transactions.14\nInvestment\n65. Alternate Investment Funds Regulations have been notified by SEBI.\nSuch alternate investment funds provide another vehicle for facilitating domestic\ninvestments.  Keeping in view the need to increase investments from all sources,\nI propose to also allow foreign investments in Alternate Investment Funds.\n66. To further simplify the procedures for Indian Companies to attract foreign\ninvestments, I propose to do away with the distinction between different types of\nforeign investments, especially between foreign portfolio investments and foreign\ndirect investments, and replace them with composite caps  The sectors which\nare already on a 100% automatic route would not be affected.\n67. The \u2018Act East\u2019 policy of the Government of India endeavours to cultivate\nextensive economic and strategic relations in South-East Asia.  In order to catalyze\ninvestments from the Indian private sector in this region, a Project Development\nCompany will, through separate Special Purpose V ehicles (SPVs), set up\nmanufacturing hubs in CMLV countries, namely, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos\nand Vietnam.\nSafe India\n68. My Government is committed to safety and security of women.  In order\nto support programmes for women security, advocacy and awareness, I have\ndecided to provide another ` 1,000 crore to the Nirbhaya Fund.\nTourism\n69. While India has 25 (twenty five) Cultural World Heritage Sites.  These\nfacilities are still deficient and require restoration, including landscape restoration;\nsignage and interpretation centres; parking; access for the differently abled;\nvisitors\u2019 amenities, including securities and toilets; illumination and plans for\nbenefiting communities around them.  I propose to provide resources to start\nwork along these lines for the following Heritage Sites:\n(i) Churches & Convents of Old Goa\n(ii) Hampi, Karnataka\n(iii) Elephanta Caves, Mumbai\n(iv) Kumbalgarh and other Hill Forts of Rajasthan\n(v) Rani ki V av, Patan, Gujarat\n(vi) Leh Palace, Ladakh, J&K\n(vii) Varanasi Temple town, UP\n(viii) Jalianwala bagh, Amritsar, Punjab\n(ix) Qutub Shahi Tombs, Hyderabad, Telengana15\n70. After the success of VISAS on arrival issued to travelers of 43 countries,\nI propose to increase the countries covered to 150, in stages.\nGreen India\n71. Madam, as environmental degradation hurts the poor more than others,\nwe are committed to make our development process as green as possible.  Our\nde facto \u2018Carbon Tax\u2019 on most petroleum products compares favourably with\ninternational norms.  With regard to coal, there is a need to find a balance between\ntaxing pollution, and the price of power.  However, beginning this year, I intend\nto start on that journey too. My Government is also launching a Scheme for\nFaster Adoption and manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME).  I am proposing\nan initial outlay of `75 crore for this Scheme in 2015-16.  The Ministry of New\nRenewable Energy has revised its target of renewable energy capacity to 1,75,000\nMW till 2022, comprising 100,000 MW Solar, 60,000 MW Wind, 10,000 MW\nBiomass and 5000 MW Small Hydro.\n72. Madam, Speaker, we are putting the scam, scandal and corruption Raj\nbehind us.  Malfeasance in public procurement can perhaps be contained by\nhaving a procurement law and an institutional structure consistent with the\nUNCITRAL model.  I believe, Parliament needs to take a view soon on whether\nwe need a procurement law, and if so, what shape it should take.\n73. On the other hand, disputes arising in public contracts take long to resolve,\nand the process is very costly too.  My Government proposes to introduce a\nPublic Contracts (Resolution of Disputes) Bill to streamline the institutional\narrangements for resolution of such disputes.\n74. There is also a need, I feel, to tackle the lack of common approach and\nphilosophy in the regulatory arrangements prevailing even within the different\nsectors of infrastructure.  Our Government, therefore, also proposes to introduce\na regulatory reform law that will bring about a cogency of approach across various\nsectors of infrastructure.\nSkill India\n75. India is one of the youngest nations in the world with more than 54% of\nthe total population below 25 years of age.  Our young people have to be both\neducated and employable for the jobs of the 21st Century.  The Prime Minister\nhas explained how Skill India needs to be closely coordinated with Make in\nIndia.  Yet today less than 5% of our potential workforce gets formal skill training\nto be employable and stay employable.\n76. We will soon be launching a National Skills Mission through the Skill\nDevelopment and Entrepreneurship Ministry.  The Mission will consolidate skill\ninitiatives spread across several Ministries and allow us to standardize procedures\nand outcomes across our 31 Sector Skill Councils.16\n77. With rural population still forming close to 70% of India\u2019s population,\nenhancing the employability of rural youth is the key to unlocking India\u2019s\ndemographic dividend.  With this in mind, we had launched the Deen Dayal\nUpadhyay Gramin Kaushal Yojana.  ` 1,500 crore has been set apart for this\nscheme.  Disbursement will be through a digital voucher directly into qualified\nstudent\u2019s bank account.\n78. This is the year when we will be entering the 100th birth anniversary of\nShri Deen Dayalji Upadhyay.  The intention of the Government is to celebrate\nthe anniversary of this great nationalist, in a befitting manner.  A 100th Birthday\nCelebration Committee will be announced soon, and adequate resources provided\nfor the celebration.\n79. With a view to enable all poor and middle class students to pursue higher\neducation of their choice without any constraint of funds, I propose to set up a\nfully IT based Student Financial Aid Authority to administer and monitor\nScholarship as well Educational Loan Schemes, through the Pradhan Mantri\nVidya Lakshmi Karyakram.  We will ensure that no student misses out on higher\neducation for lack of funds.\n80. Hon\u2019ble Members will remember that in the Budget Speech of July,\nI had indicated my intention to provide one major Central Institute in each State.\nIn the fiscal year 2015-16, I propose to set up All India Institutes of Medical\nSciences in J&K, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh and Assam.  Keeping\nin view the need to augment Medical Sciences in Bihar, I propose to set up\nanother AIIMS like institution in these States.  I propose to set up an IIT in\nKarnataka, and upgrade Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad into a full-fledged\nIIT.  I also propose to set up a Post Graduate Institute of Horticulture Research\nand Education in Amritsar.  IIMs will be  setup in J&K and Andhra Pradesh.  In\nKerala, I propose to upgrade the existing National Institute of Speech and Hearing\nto a University of Disability Studies and Rehabilitation.  I also propose three\nnew National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research: in\nMaharashtra, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh; and an Institutes of Science and\nEducation Research in Nagaland and Odisha.  I also propose to set up a Centre\nfor Film Production, Animation and Gaming in Arunachal Pradesh, for the North-\nEastern States; and Apprenticeship Training Institute for Women in Haryana and\nUttrakhand.\n81. In order to improve the Governance of Public Sector banks, the\nGovernment intends to set up an autonomous bank Board Bureau. The Bureau\nwill search and select heads of Public Sector banks and help them in developing\ndifferentiated strategies and capital raising plans through innovative financial\nmethods and instruments.  This would be an interim step towards establishing a\nholding and investment Company for Banks.17\nDigital India\n82. Madam, Speaker, I would like to inform the House we are making good\nprogress towards making Digital India.  The National Optical Fibre Network\nProgramme (NOFNP) of 7.5 lakh kms. networking 2.5 lakh villages is being\nfurther speeded up by allowing willing States to undertake its execution, on\nreimbursement of cost as determined by Department of Telecommunications.\nAndhra Pradesh is the first State to have opted for this manner of implementation.\n83. As Members are aware, in making their recommendations, the Finance\nCommission has not distinguished between special category and other states.\nMoreover, both Bihar and West Bengal are going to be amongst the biggest\nbeneficiaries of the recommendations of the Finance Commission. Yet, the Eastern\nStates have to be given an opportunity to grow even faster.  I, therefore, propose\nto give similar special assistance to Bihar and West Bengal as has been provided\nby the Government of India in the case of Government of Andhra Pradesh.  As\nregards Andhra Pradesh and Telengana, the Government is committed to comply\nwith all the legal commitments made to these States at the time of reorganization.\n84. In spite of the large increase in devolution to states, which implies reduced\nfiscal space for the Centre in the same proportion we are committed to the welfare\nof the poor and the neo-middle class. Keeping this in mind, adequate provision\nis being made for the schemes for the poor and the dis-advantaged.  Illustratively,\nI have allocated ` 68,968 crore to the education sector including mid-day meals,\n` 33,152 crore to the health sector and ` 79,526 crore for rural development\nactivities including MGNREGA, ` 22,407 crore for housing and urban\ndevelopment, ` 10,351 crore for women and child development, ` 4,173 crore\nfor Water Resources and Namami Gange. The significant sums that will be spent\nby the States on these programmes will ensure a quantum leap in expenditures in\nthese areas. I urge states to utilize their enhanced resources effectively in these\nareas.\n85. Madam, Speaker, I am delighted to report good progress for DMIC\ncorridors: the Ahmedabad-Dhaulera Investment Region in Gujarat, and the\nShendra\u2013Bidkin Industrial Park near Aurangabad, in Maharashtra, are now in a\nposition to start work on basic infrastructure.  In the current year, I have earmarked\nan initial sum of ` 1,200 crore.  However, as the pace of expenditure picks up, I\nwill provide them additional funds.\n86. Defence of every square inch of our mother land comes before anything\nelse.  So far, we have been over dependent on imports, with its attendant\nunwelcome spin-offs.  Our Government has already permitted FDI in defence so\nthat the Indian-controlled entities also become manufacturers of defence\nequipments, not only for us, but for export.  We are thus pursuing the Make in\nIndia policy to achieve greater self-sufficiency in the area of defence equipment,18\nincluding aircraft.  Members of this august House would have noted that we\nhave been both transparent and quick in making  defence equipment related\npurchase decisions, thus keeping our defence forces ready for any eventuality.\nThis year too, I have provided adequately for the needs of the armed forces.  As\nagainst likely expenditure of this year of ` 2,22,370 crore the budget allocation\nfor 2015-16 is ` 2,46,727 crore.\n87. While India produces some of the finest financial minds, including in\ninternational finance, they have few avenues in India to fully exhibit and exploit\ntheir strength to the country\u2019s advantage.  GIFT in Gujarat was envisaged as\nInternational Finance Centre that would actually become as good an International\nFinance Centre as Singapore or Dubai, which, incidentally, are largely manned\nby Indians.  The proposal has languished for years.  I am glad to announce that\nthe first phase of GIFT will soon become a reality. Appropriate regulations will\nbe issued in March.\n88. For the quick resolution of commercial disputes, the Government proposes\nto set up exclusive commercial divisions in various courts in India based on the\nrecommendations of the 253rd Report of the Law Commission. The Government\nproposes to introduce a Bill in the parliament after consulting stakeholders in\nthis regard.\n89. Madam Speaker, the Government will, during this session, also place\nbefore the Parliament the required Bills, to convert Ordinances issued by the\nGovernment into Acts of Parliament.\nBUDGET ESTIMATES\n90. I now turn to the Budget Estimates for Budget 2015-16.\n91. Non-Plan expenditure estimates for the Financial Year are estimated at\n`13,12,200 crore.  Plan expenditure is estimated to be ` 4,65,277 crore, which is\nvery near to the R.E. of 2014-15.  Total Expenditure has accordingly been\nestimated at ` 17,77,477 crore. The requirements for expenditure on Defence,\nInternal Security and other necessary expenditures are adequately provided.\n92. Gross Tax receipts are estimated to be ` 14,49,490 crore.  Devolution to\nthe States is estimated to be  ` 5,23,958 crore.  Share of Central Government will\nbe ` 9,19,842 crore.  Non Tax Revenues for the next fiscal are estimated to be\n`2,21,733 crore.\n93. With the above estimates, fiscal deficit will be 3.9 per cent of GDP and\nRevenue Deficit will be 2.8 per cent of GDP.19\nPART  B\nMadam Speaker,\n94. I now turn to my tax proposals.\n95. Taxation is an instrument of social and economic engineering.  Tax\ncollections help the Government to provide education, healthcare, housing and\nother basic facilities to the people to improve their quality of life and to address\nthe problems of poverty, unemployment and slow development.  To achieve\nthese objectives, it has been our endeavour in the last nine months to foster a\nstable taxation policy and non-adversarial tax administration.  A very important\ndimension to our tax administration is the fight against the scourge of black\nmoney.  A number of measures have already been taken in this direction.\nI propose to do much more.\n96. We need to revive growth and investment to ensure that more jobs are\ncreated for our youth and benefits of development reach millions of our poor.\nWe need an enabling tax policy for this.  I have already introduced the Bill to\namend the Constitution of India for Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the last\nSession of this august House.  GST is expected to play a transformative role in\nthe way our economy functions.  It will add buoyancy to our economy by\ndeveloping a common Indian market and reducing the cascading effect on the\ncost of goods and services.  We are moving in various fronts to implement GST\nfrom the next year.\n97. We need to match this transformative piece of legislation in indirect\ntaxation with transformative measures in direct taxation.  The basic rate of\nCorporate Tax in India at 30% is higher than the rates prevalent in the other\nmajor Asian economies, making our domestic industry uncompetitive.  Moreover,\nthe effective collection of Corporate Tax is about 23%.  We lose out on both\ncounts, i.e. we are considered as having a high Corporate Tax regime but we do\nnot get that tax due to excessive exemptions.  A regime of exemptions has led to\npressure groups, litigation and loss of revenue.  It also gives room for avoidable\ndiscretion.  I, therefore, propose to reduce the rate of Corporate Tax from 30% to\n25% over the next 4 years.  This will lead to higher level of investment, higher\ngrowth and more jobs.  This process of reduction has to be necessarily\naccompanied by rationalisation and removal of various kinds of tax exemptions\nand incentives for corporate taxpayers, which incidentally account for a large\nnumber of tax disputes.\n98. I wanted to start the phased reduction of corporate tax rate and phased\nelimination of exemptions right away; but I thought it would be appropriate to\ngive advance notice that these changes will start from the next financial year.20\nOur stated policy is to avoid sudden surprises and instability in tax policy.\nExemptions to individual taxpayers will, however, continue since they facilitate\nsavings which get transferred to investment and economic growth.\n99. While finalising my tax proposals, I have adopted certain broad themes,\nwhich include:\nA. Measures to curb black money;\nB. Job creation through revival of growth and investment and promotion\nof domestic manufacturing and \u2018Make in India\u2019;\nC. Minimum government and maximum governance to improve the\nease of doing business;\nD. Benefits to middle class taxpayers;\nE. Improving the quality of life and public health through Swachch\nBharat initiatives; and\nF. Stand alone proposals to maximise benefits to the economy.\n100. Madam Speaker, the first and foremost pillar of my tax proposals is to\neffectively deal with the problem of black money which eats into the vitals of\nour economy and society.  The problems of poverty and inequity cannot be\neliminated unless generation of black money and its concealment is dealt with\neffectively and forcefully.\n101. In the last 9 months several measures have been initiated in this direction.\nA major breakthrough was achieved in October, 2014 when a delegation from\nthe Revenue Department visited Switzerland and the Swiss authorities agreed to\n(a) provide information in respect of cases independently investigated by the\nIncome-tax Department; (b) confirm genuineness of bank accounts and provide\nnon-banking information; (c) provide such information in a time bound manner;\nand (d) commence talks with India for Automatic Exchange of Information\nbetween the two countries at the earliest.  Investigation into cases of undisclosed\nforeign assets has been accorded the highest priority, resulting in detection of\nsubstantial amounts of unreported income.  For strengthening collection of\ninformation from various sources domestically, a new structure is being put in\nplace which includes electronic filing of statements by reporting entities.  This\nwill ensure seamless integration of data and more effective enforcement.\n102. Tracking down and bringing back the wealth which legitimately belongs\nto the country is our abiding commitment to the country.   Recognising the\nlimitations under the existing legislation, we have taken a considered decision\nto enact a comprehensive new law on black money to specifically deal with such\nmoney stashed away abroad.  To this end, I propose to introduce a Bill in the\ncurrent Session of the Parliament.21\n103. With your permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to highlight some\nof the key features of the proposed new law on black money.\n(1) Concealment of income and assets and evasion of tax in relation to\nforeign assets will be prosecutable with punishment of rigorous\nimprisonment upto 10 years.  Further,\n\u2022 this offence will be made non-compoundable;\n\u2022 the offenders will not be permitted to approach the Settlement\nCommission; and\n\u2022 penalty for such concealment of income and assets at the rate of\n300% of tax shall be levied.\n(2) Non filing of return or filing of return with inadequate disclosure of\nforeign assets will be liable for prosecution with punishment of\nrigorous imprisonment up to 7 years.\n(3) Income in relation to any undisclosed foreign asset or undisclosed\nincome from any foreign asset will be taxable at the maximum\nmarginal rate.  Exemptions or deductions which may otherwise be\napplicable in such cases, shall not be allowed.\n(4) Beneficial owner or beneficiary of foreign assets will be mandatorily\nrequired to file return, even if there is no taxable income.\n(5) Abettors of the above offences, whether individuals, entities, banks\nor financial institutions will be liable for prosecution and penalty.\n(6) Date of Opening of foreign account would be mandatorily required\nto be specified by the assessee in the return of income.\n(7) The offence of concealment of income or evasion of tax in relation\nto a foreign asset will be made a predicate offence under the\nPrevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). This provision\nwould enable the enforcement agencies to attach and confiscate\nunaccounted assets held abroad and launch prosecution against\npersons indulging in laundering of black money.\n(8) The definition of \u2018proceeds of crime\u2019 under PMLA is being amended\nto enable attachment and confiscation of equivalent asset in India\nwhere the asset located abroad cannot be forfeited.\n(9) The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) is also being\namended to the effect that if any foreign exchange, foreign security\nor any immovable property situated outside India is held in\ncontravention of the provisions of this Act, then action may be taken22\nfor seizure and eventual confiscation of assets of equivalent value\nsituated in India.  These contraventions are also being made liable\nfor levy of penalty and prosecution with punishment of imprisonment\nup to five years.\n104. As regards curbing domestic black money, a new and more comprehensive\nBenami Transactions (Prohibition) Bill will be introduced in the current session\nof the Parliament.  This law will enable confiscation of benami property and\nprovide for prosecution, thus blocking a major avenue for generation and holding\nof black money in the form of benami property, especially in real estate.\n105. A few other measures are also proposed in the Budget for curbing black\nmoney within the country.  The Finance Bill includes a proposal to amend the\nIncome-tax Act to prohibit acceptance or payment of an advance of `20,000 or\nmore in cash for purchase of immovable property.  Quoting of PAN is being\nmade mandatory for any purchase or sale exceeding the value of `1 lakh.  The\nthird party reporting entities would be required to furnish information about\nforeign currency sales and cross border transactions.  Provision is also being\nmade to tackle splitting of reportable transactions.  To improve enforcement,\nCBDT and CBEC will leverage technology and have access to information in\neach other\u2019s database.\n106. Madam Speaker, the second pillar of my taxation proposals this year is\njob creation through revival of growth and investment and promotion of domestic\nmanufacturing and \u2018Make in India\u2019.  I propose to undertake a series of steps in\nthis direction to attract capital, both domestic and foreign.  Tax \u2018pass through\u2019 is\nproposed to be allowed to both Category-I and Category-II Alternative Investment\nFunds, so that tax is levied on the investors in these Funds and not on the Funds\nper se.  This will step up the ability of these Funds to mobilise higher resources\nand make higher investments in small and medium enterprises, infrastructure\nand social projects and provide the much required private equity to new ventures\nand start-ups.\n107. A step was taken in the last Budget to encourage Real Estate Investment\nTrusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investments Trusts (InvITs) by providing partial\npass through to them.  These collective investment vehicles have an important\nrole to revive construction activity.  A large quantum of funds is locked up in\nvarious completed projects which need to be released to facilitate new\ninfrastructure projects to take off.   I therefore propose to rationalise the capital\ngains regime for the sponsors exiting at the time of listing of the units of REITs\nand InvITs, subject to payment of Securities Transaction Tax (STT).  The rental\nincome of REITs from their own assets will have pass through facility.23\n108. The present taxation structure has an inbuilt incentive for fund managers\nto operate from offshore locations. To encourage such offshore fund managers\nto relocate to India, I propose to modify the Permanent Establishment (PE) norms\nto the effect that mere presence of a fund manager in India would not constitute\nPE of the offshore funds resulting in adverse tax consequences.\n109. Implementation of the General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) has been a\nmatter of public debate.  The investment sentiment in the country has now turned\npositive and we need to accelerate this momentum.  There are also certain\ncontentious issues relating to GAAR which need to be resolved.  It has therefore\nbeen decided to defer the applicability of GAAR by two years.   Further, it has\nalso been decided that when implemented, GAAR would apply prospectively to\ninvestments made on or after 01.04.2017.\n110. Today I see a lot of young entrepreneurs running business ventures or\nwanting to start new ones.  They need latest technology.  Therefore, to facilitate\ntechnology inflow to small businesses at low costs, I propose to reduce the rate\nof income tax on royalty and fees for technical services from 25% to 10%.\n111. To generate greater employment opportunities, it is proposed to extend\nthe benefit of deduction for employment of new regular workmen to all business\nentities.  The eligibility threshold of minimum 100 regular workmen is being\nreduced to fifty.\n112. The role of indirect taxes is also very important in the context of promotion\nof domestic manufacturing and Make in India.  In indirect taxes, therefore, I\npropose to reduce the rates of basic customs duty on certain inputs, raw materials,\nintermediates and components (in all 22 items) so as to minimise the impact of\nduty inversion and reduce the manufacturing cost in several sectors.   Some\nother changes address the problem of CENV A T credit accumulation due to the\nlevy of SAD.  I propose to fully exempt all goods, except populated printed\ncircuit boards for use in manufacture of ITA bound items from SAD and reduce\nthe SAD on imports of certain other inputs and raw materials subject to actual\nuser condition. These changes are detailed in the Annexure to the Budget Speech.\n113. My next proposal is regarding minimum government and maximum\ngovernance with focus on ease of doing business and simplification of Tax\nProcedures without compromising on tax revenues.  The total wealth tax collection\nin the country was `1,008 crore in 2013-14.  Should a tax which leads to high\ncost of collection and a low yield be continued or should it be replaced with a\nlow cost and higher yield tax?  The rich and wealthy must pay more tax than the\nless affluent ones.  I have therefore decided to abolish the wealth tax and replace\nit with an additional surcharge of 2% on the super-rich with a taxable income of\nover `1 crore.  This will lead to tax simplification and enable the Department to24\nfocus more on ensuring tax compliance and widening the tax base. As against a\ntax sacrifice of `1,008 crore, through these measures the Department would be\ncollecting about `9,000 crore from the 2% additional surcharge.  Further, to\ntrack the wealth held by individuals and entities, the information regarding the\nassets which are currently required to be furnished in wealth-tax return will be\ncaptured in the income tax returns.  This will ensure that the abolition of wealth\ntax does not lead to escape of any income from the tax net.\n114. The provision relating to indirect transfers in the Income-tax Act which\nis a legacy from the previous government contains several ambiguities.   This\nprovision is being suitably cleaned up. Further, concerns regarding applicability\nof indirect transfer provisions to dividends paid by foreign companies to their\nshareholders will be addressed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes through a\nclarificatory circular.  These changes would eliminate the scope for discretionary\nexercise of power and provide a hassle free structure to the taxpayers. I reiterate\nwhat I had said in the last Budget that ordinarily retrospective tax provisions\nadversely impact the stability and predictability of the taxation regime and resort\nto such provisions shall be avoided.\n115. Further, to reduce the associated hassles to smaller taxpayers and the\ncompliance costs in domestic transfer pricing, I propose to increase the threshold\nlimit from `5 crore to `20 crore.\n116. In order to rationalise the MAT provisions for FIIs, profits corresponding\nto their income from capital gains on transactions in securities which are liable\nto tax at a lower rate, shall not be subject to MAT.\n117. The Tax Administration Reform Commission (TARC) has given a number\nof recommendations to improve the administration in the Tax Departments.  These\nrecommendations are in advanced stage of examination and will be appropriately\nimplemented during the course of this year.\n118. As part of the movement towards GST, I propose to subsume the\nEducation Cess and the Secondary and Higher Education Cess in Central Excise\nduty.  In effect, the general rate of Central Excise Duty of 12.36% including the\ncesses is being rounded off to 12.5%.  I also propose to revise the specific rates\nof Central Excise duty in certain other commodities, as detailed in the Annexure.\nHowever, in the case of petrol and diesel such specific rates are being revised\nonly to the extent of subsuming the quantum of education cess presently levied\non them, keeping the total incidence of excise duties unchanged.  The ad-valorem\nrates of excise duty lower than 12% and those higher than 12% with a few\nexceptions are not being increased.  Some changes are also being made to excise\nlevy on cigarettes and the compounded levy scheme applicable to pan masala,\ngutkha and certain other tobacco products.25\n119. To give a boost to domestic leather footwear industry, the excise duty on\nfootwear with leather uppers and having retail price of more than `1000 per pair\nis being reduced to 6%.\n120. To further facilitate the ease of doing business, online central excise and\nservice tax registration will be done in two working days.  The assessees under\nthese taxes will be allowed to issue digitally signed invoices and maintain\nelectronic records.  These measures will cut down lot of paper work and red\ntape. Time limit for taking CENV A T credit on inputs and input services is being\nincreased from six months to one year as a measure of business facilitation.\n121. Introduction of GST is eagerly awaited by Trade and Industry.  To facilitate\na smooth transition to levy of tax on services by both the Centre and the States,\nit is proposed to increase the present rate of service tax plus education cesses\nfrom 12.36% to a consolidated rate of 14%.\n122. Madam Speaker, cleanliness of households and clean environment are\nvery important social causes.  The fourth pillar of my taxation proposals this\nyear therefore relates to initiatives for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.  In my direct\ntax proposals, I have proposed 100% deduction for contributions, other than by\nway of CSR contributions, to the Swachh Bharat Kosh.  A similar tax treatment\nis also proposed for the Clean Ganga Fund.\n123. In indirect taxes, I propose to increase the Clean Energy Cess from `100\nto `200 per metric tonne of coal, etc. to finance clean environment initiatives.\nExcise duty on sacks and bags of polymers of ethylene other than for industrial\nuse is being increased from 12% to 15%.  It is also proposed to have an enabling\nprovision to levy Swachh Bharat Cess at a rate of 2% or less on all or certain\nservices if need arises.  This Cess will be effective from a date to be notified.\nResources generated from this cess will be utilised for financing and promoting\ninitiatives towards Swachh Bharat.\n124. It is also proposed to exempt services by common affluent treatment\nplants from service tax.  The concessions from customs and excise duties currently\navailable on specified parts for manufacture of electrically operated vehicles\nand hybrid vehicles are being extended by one more year i.e. up to 31.3.2016.\n125. Madam Speaker, the fifth pillar of my taxation proposals this year is\nextension of benefits to middle class tax payers.  The proposals in this regard are\nas follows :\n\u00be Increase in the limit of deduction in respect of health insurance\npremium from `15,000 to `25,000.\no For senior citizens the limit will stand increased to `30,000  from\nthe existing `20,000.26\no For very senior citizens of the age of 80 years or more, who are\nnot covered by health insurance, deduction of  ` 30,000 towards\nexpenditure incurred on their treatment will be allowed.\n\u00be The deduction limit of ` 60,000 towards expenditure on account of\nspecified diseases of serious nature is proposed to be enhanced to\n`80,000 in case of very senior citizens.\n\u00be Additional deduction of ` 25,000 will be allowed for differently abled\npersons under Section 80DD and Section 80U of the Income-tax\nAct.\n\u00be The limit on deduction on account of contribution to a Pension Fund\nand the New Pension Scheme is proposed to be increased from\n`1 lakh to `1.5 lakh.\n\u00be To provide social safety net and the facility of pension to individuals,\nan additional deduction of ` 50,000 is proposed to be provided for\ncontribution to the New Pension Scheme under Section 80CCD.\nThis will enable India to become a pensioned society instead of a\npensionless society.\n\u00be Investments in Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme is already eligible for\ndeduction under Section 80C.  All payments to the beneficiaries\nincluding interest payment on deposit will also be fully exempt.\n\u00be Transport allowance exemption is being increased from `800 to\n`1,600 per month.\n\u00be For the benefit of senior citizens, service tax exemption will be\nprovided on V arishta Bima Yojana.\n126. Madam Speaker, I am giving these concessions to individual taxpayers\ndespite inadequate fiscal space.  After taking into account the tax concession\ngiven to middle class tax payers in my last Budget and this Budget, today an\nindividual tax payer will get tax benefit of `4,44,200 as detailed in the annexure.\nAs and when my fiscal capacity improves, individual taxpayers will have a lot to\nlook forward to.\n127. Madam Speaker, there are several stand-alone proposals relating to\ntaxation.  These include conversion of existing excise duty on petrol and diesel\nto the extent of `4 per litre into Road Cess to fund investment in roads and other\ninfrastructure.  An additional sum of ` 40,000 crore will be made available through\nthis measure for these sectors.  In service tax, exemption is being extended to\ncertain pre cold storage services in relation to fruits and vegetables so as to27\nincentivise value addition in this crucial sector.  The Negative List under service\ntax is being slightly pruned and certain other exemptions are being withdrawn to\nwiden the tax base.\n128. Yoga is India\u2019s well acknowledged gift to the world.  It is proposed to\ninclude yoga within the ambit of charitable purpose under Section 2(15) of the\nIncome-tax Act.  Further, to mitigate the problem being faced by many genuine\ncharitable institutions, it is proposed to modify the ceiling on receipts from\nactivities in the nature of trade, commerce or business to 20% of the total receipts\nfrom the existing ceiling of `25 lakh.  A national database of non profit\norganisations is also being developed.\n129. Enactment of a Direct Taxes Code (DTC) has been under discussion for\nquite some time.  Most of the provisions of the DTC have already been included\nin the Income-tax Act.  Among the very few aspects of DTC which were left out,\nwe have addressed some of the issues in the present Budget.  Further, the\njurisprudence under the Income-tax Act is well evolved. Considering all these\naspects, there is no great merit in going ahead with the Direct Tax Code as it\nexists today.\n130. Madam Speaker, the details of direct and indirect tax proposals are given\nin the Annexure to the Budget speech and the other budget documents laid on\nthe Table of the House.  My direct tax proposals would result in revenue loss of\n`8,315 crore, whereas the proposals in indirect taxes are expected to yield `23,383\ncrore.  Thus, the net impact of all tax proposals would be revenue gain of `15,068\ncrore.\nCONCLUSION\n131. To conclude, Madam Speaker, it is no secret that expectations of this\nBudget have been high.  People who urge us to undertake Big Bang Reforms,\nalso say that the Indian economy is a giant super tanker, or an elephant.  An\nelephant, Madam Speaker, moves slowly but surely.  Even our worst critics would\nadmit that we have moved rapidly.  In this speech, I think I have clearly outlined\nnot only what we are going to do immediately, but also a roadmap for the future.\n132. I think I can genuinely stake, for our Government, a claim of intellectual\nhonesty.  We have been consistent in what we have said, and what we are doing.\nWe are committed, Madam Speaker, to achieving what we have been voted to\npower for:  Change, growth, jobs and genuine, effective upliftment of the poor\nand the under-privileged.  Our commitment to the \u2018Daridra Narayan\u2019 is steadfast,\nas is commitment to the Constitutional principles of Equality and Justice for All,28\nwithout concern for caste, creed or religion.
