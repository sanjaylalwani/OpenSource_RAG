    "content": "5 \n \n \nhave undertaken targeted expenditure to improve their quality of life in \nall its dimensions.  Our aim , is to provide urban facilities in villages while \nkeeping the soul of rural life intact. \n18. Under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, construction of \nrural roads has been tripled. 15.80 lakh habitations out of a total of 17.84 \nlakh habitations have already been connected with pucca roads and work \nis going on to complete the rest very soon. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak \nYojana (PMGSY) is being allocated ` 19,000 crore in BE 2019-20 as against \n` 15,500 crore in RE 2018-19.  There was time when a child used to reach \nschool after walking on a foot trail, today  the situation has changed and a bus \ncan reach her/his village During the period 2014-18, a total number of 1.53 \ncrore houses have been built under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. \n19. Till the year 2014, about 2.5 crore families were forced to live the life of \n18th centuary without electricity. Under 'Saubhagya Yojna', we provided free \nelectricity connection to almost every household. By March, 2019, all willing  \nfamilies will get electricity connection. In mission mode, we have provided 143 \ncrore LED bulbs with the participation of private sector. This has resulted into a \nsavings of approximately ` 50,000 crore per year in electricity b ills of poor and \nmiddle class families. \n20. Madam Speaker, past five years have seen massive scale up of \nhealth care.  Earlier, a poor man used to be in dilemma whether to fulfil daily \nneeds of the family or save the life of an ailing member. This situation has \ndeeply pained our Hon'ble Prime Minister. We  launched the world\u2019s largest \nhealthcare programme, Ayushman Bharat, to provide medical treatment to \nnearly 50 crore people. Already close to 10 lakh patients have benefited \nfor medical treatment which would have cost them ` 3,000 crore  through \nfree treatment made available under the scheme.  Lakhs of poor and middle \nclass people are also benefiting from reduction in the prices of essential \nmedicines, cardiac stents and knee implants, and availability of medicines \nat affordable prices through Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendras.  \n21. There are 21 AIIMS operating or being established in the country \npresently. 14 of these 21 AIIIMS have been announced since 2014. I am \nhappy to announce setting up of new the 22nd AIIMS in Haryana. 6 \n \n \n22. The Aspirational Districts Programme is providing targeted \ndevelopment to the 115 most backward districts of the country. The \nprogramme has achieved notable results with improved performance on \nall indicators - health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water \nresources, financial inclusion and skill development.  \nFarmer's progress and Increase in Income \n23. Madam Speaker, our hard working farmers were not getting the full \nvalue of their produce. With an aim to double the income of farmers, our \nGovernment,  for the first time in history  has fixed the minimum support price \n(MSP) of all 22 crops at minimum 50% more than the cost. \n24. Agriculture continues to be the main driver of the rural economy. \nOur hard-working farmers, supported by pro-farmer policies of our \nGovernment in the past four and half years, have produced agriculture \ncommodities in record quantities. Declining prices of agricultural \ncommodities in the international market and fall in food inflation in India \nsince 2017-18, relative to non-food sector, have however, reduced the \nreturns from farming.  Small and fragmented land holding on account of \nrepeated divisions has also contributed in decline in the income of the \nfarmer family. Hence, there is a need for providing structured income \nsupport to the poor land-holder farmer families in the country for \nprocuring inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, equipment, labour etc. and to \nmeet other needs. Such support will help them in avoiding indebtedness \nas well and falling into clutches of money lenders. \n25. To provide an assured income support to the small and marginal \nfarmers, our Government  is launching a historic programme namely \n\u201cPradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)\u201d. Under this \nprogramme, vulnerable landholding farmer families, having cultivable land \nupto 2 hectares, will be provided direct income support at the rate of \n`6,000 per year. This income support will be transferred directly into the \nbank accounts of beneficiary farmers, in three equal instalments of `  2,000 \neach. This programme will be funded by Government of India. Around 12 \ncrore small and marginal farmer families are expected to benefit from \nthis. The programme would be made effective from 1st December 2018 \nand the first instalment for the period upto 31st March 2019 would be \npaid during this year itself. This programme will entail an annual \nexpenditure of `  75,000 crore. 7 \n \n \n26. PM-KISAN would not only provide assured supplemental income to \nthe most vulnerable farmer families, but would also meet their emergent \nneeds especially before the harvest season. PM-KISAN would pave the \nway for the farmers to earn and live a respectable living.    \n27. I propose an outlay of ` 75,000 crore for PM-KISAN for the \nFY 2019-20. I am also providing `  20,000 crore in the Revised Estimates of \nFY 2018-19. \n28. During the last five years, for providing affordable loans to farmers, the \namount of interest subvention has been doubled. The crop loan to farmers \nincreased to ` 11.68 lakh crore in year 2018-19. We have made genuine efforts \nto remove the hardships of farmers by providing them Soil Health Cards, \nquality seeds, irrigation scheme and Neem Coated Urea to remove shortage of \nfertilizers. \n29. Animal Husbandry and Fisheries sector also needs considerable \nsupport. I have increased the allocation for Rashtriya Gokul Mission to `750 \ncrore in the current year itself. I announce setting up of \"Rashtriya  Kamdhenu \nAayog\" to  upscale sustainable genetic up-gradation of cow resources and \nto enhance production and productivity of cows. The Aayog will also look \nafter effective implementation of laws and welfare schemes for cows. \n30. India is the second largest fish producing nation in the world \naccounting for 6.3% of global production, registering an average annual \ngrowth of more than 7% in recent years. The sector provides livelihood to \nabout 1.45 crore people at the primary level. To provide sustained and \nfocused attention towards development of this sector, our Government \nhas decided to create a separate Department of Fisheries.  \n31. In the last Budget, our  Government announced the facility of \nextension of Kisan Credit Card scheme (KCC) to Animal Husbandry and \nFisheries farmers.  Now, I propose to provide the benefit of 2% interest \nsubvention to the farmers pursuing the activities of animal husbandry and \nfisheries, who avail loan through Kisan Credit Card. Further, in case of \ntimely repayment of loan, they will also get an additional 3% interest \nsubvention.  \n32. To ensure provision of easy and concessional credit  and to bring  all \nfarmers under KCC fold, our Government  has decided to initiate a \ncomprehensive drive with a simplified application form.   8 \n \n \n33. When natural calamities strike, farmers are generally unable to \nrepay their crop loans.  Presently, the crop loans are rescheduled for such \naffected farmers and they get benefit of interest subvention of 2% only \nfor the first year of the rescheduled loan. Our Government has now  \ndecided that all farmers affected by severe natural calamities, where \nassistance is provided from National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF),   will be \nprovided the benefit of interest subvention of 2% and prompt repayment \nincentive of 3% for the entire period of reschedulement of their loans.  \nLabour and Workers Dignity \n34. Madam Speaker, our Government firmly believes that workmen and all \nthe people working in Government services should get benefit of the fast \ngrowing economy. During the last five years India has witnessed industrial \npeace. \n35. High growth and formalistation of the economy has led to the  \nexpansion of employment opportunities as shown in EPFO membership, \nwhich has increased by nearly 2 crore in two years reflecting formalisation \nof the economy and job creations. \n36. After submission of the 7th Central Pay Commission Report, the \nrecommendations were implemented immediately. The New Pension Scheme \n(NPS) has been liberalized. Keeping the contribution of the employee at 10%, \nwe have increased the Government contribution b y 4% making it 14%. \nMaximum ceiling of the bonus given to the labourers has been increased from \n` 3,500 pm to ` 7,000 pm and the maximum ceiling of the pay has been \nincreased from ` 10,000 pm to ` 21,000 pm. The ceiling of payment of gratuity \nhas been enhanced from ` 10 lakhs to ` 20 lakhs. During the last five years the \nminimum wages of labourers of the all categories have been increased by 42%, \nwhich is the highest ever. The ceiling of ESI's eligi bility cover has been \nincreased from ` 15,000 pm to ` 21,000 pm.  Minimum pension for every \nlabourer has been fixed at ` 1,000 per month. In the event of death of a \nlabourer during service, the amount to be paid by EPFO has been enhanced \nfrom ` 2.5 lakh to ` 6 lakh. Under Anganwadi and Asha Yojana honorarium has \nbeen enhanced by about 50% for all categories of workers. \n37. Half of India\u2019s GDP comes from the sweat and toil of 42 crore \nworkers in the unorganised sector working as street vendors, rickshaw \npullers, construction workers, rag pickers, agricultural workers, beedi \nworkers, handloom, leather and in numerous other similar  occupations. \nDomestic workers are also engaged in big numbers. We must provide them \ncomprehensive social security coverage for  their old age. Therefore, in 9 \n \n \naddition to the health coverage provided under \u2018Ayushman Bharat\u2019 and \nlife & disability coverage provided under \u2018Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti \nBima Yojana\u2019 and \u2018Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana\u2019, our Government \nproposes to launch a mega pension yojana namely 'Pradhan Mantri \nShram-Yogi Maandhan' for the unorganised sector workers with monthly \nincome upto ` 15,000. This pension yojana shall provide them an assured \nmonthly pension of ` 3,000 from the age of 60 years  on a monthly \ncontribution of a small affordable amount during their working age. An \nunorganised sector worker joining pension yojana at the age of 29 years \nwill have to contribute only ` 100 per month till the age of 60 years. A \nworker joining the pension yojana at 18 years, will have to contribute as \nlittle as ` 55 per month only. The Government will deposit equal matching \nshare in the pension account of the worker every month. It is expected \nthat at least 10 crore labourers and workers in the unorganised sector \nwill avail the benefit of 'Pradhan Mantri Shram-Yogi Maandhan' within \nnext five years making it one of the largest pension schemes of the \nworld. A sum of `500 crore has been allocated for the  Scheme. Additional \nfunds will be provided as needed. The scheme will also be implemented from \nthe current year.  \n38. Our Government is committed to reach the most deprived citizens of \nthis country. To this end, the condition of the De -notified, Nomadic and Semi -\nNomadic communities merits special attention. These communities are hard to \nreach, less visible, and therefore, frequently left out.  The Nomadic and Semi -\nNomadic communities move from place to place in search of a livelihood. The \nRenke Commission and the Idate Commission have done commendable work \nto identify and list th ese communities. A Committee under NITI Aayog will be \nset up to complete the task of identifying De -notified, Nomadic and Semi -\nNomadic communities not yet formally classified. Our Government will also set \nup a Welfare Development Board under the Ministry o f Social Justice and \nEmpowerment specifically for the purpose of implementing welfare and \ndevelopment programmes for De -notified, Nomadic and Semi -Nomadic \ncommunities.  The Board shall ensure that special strategies are designed and \nimplemented to serve these hard-to-reach communities. \nWomen\u2019s development to women led development  \n39. Madam Speaker, in our Election Manifesto, we had promised that \nwe will transform the quality of life of women in rural India by providing \ncleaner fuel. For securing the health of every home-maker in rural areas \nand to ensure that she does not have to shed tears for cooking food to \nnourish her family, our Government embarked upon a programme to 10 \n \n \ndeliver 8 crore free LPG connections under the Ujjwala Yojana. More than \n6 crore connections have already been given and the remaining will get \nfree gas connections by next year. Ujjwala is a remarkable success story of \nour Government programme, defined by a bold yet practical Vision of a \nresponsible and compassionate leadership. \n40. More than 70% of the beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri MUDRA \nYojana are women who are getting affordable and collateral-free loans to \nstart their own businesses. Amongst many measures,  benefits of Maternity \nleave of 26 weeks and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana for \npregnant women have provided financial support to women while \nempowering them to participate in work. \nEmpowering Youth to fulfil their potential \n41. India is amongst the most youthful nations in the world. Through \nPradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, over 1 crore youth are being \ntrained to help them earn a livelihood. We have harnessed \u00aa\u00c9\u00d6\u00b4\u00c9\u00c9 \u00b6\u00c9\u00c9\u00cak\u00c9E \nthrough self-employment schemes including MUDRA, Start-up India and \nStand-up India. Under MUDRA Yojana  15.56 crore loans have been disbursed \namounting to `7,23,000 crore. The concept of employment is changing all over \nthe world, now the employment generation is not confined merely to \nGovernment services or factories.  With job seekers becoming job creators, \nIndia has become the world\u2019s second largest start-up hub. We are proud of \nthe hard work and innovative ideas of our youth. \n42. In order to take the benefits of Artificial Intelligence and related \ntechnologies to the people, a National Programme on 'Artificial Intelligen ce' \nhas been envisaged by our Government. This would be catalysed by the \nestablishment of the National Centre on Artificial Intelligence as a hub along \nwith Centres of Excellence. Nine priority areas have been identified. A National \nArtificial Intelligence portal will also be developed soon. \nEmpowering MSMEs and Traders \n43. Government has undertaken many effective steps to strengthen MSME \nsector, which provides employment to crores  of people. Recently, a scheme of \nsanctioning loans upto ` 1 crore  in 59 minutes has been launched. GST -\nregistered SME units will get 2% interest rebate on incremental loan of ` 1 \nCrore. The requirement of sourcing from SMEs by Government enterprises has \nbeen increased to 25%.  Of this, the material to the extent of at least 3% will be \nsourced from women owned SMEs. 11 \n \n \n44. Government e-Marketplace (GeM), created by our Government two \nyears ago, has transformed public procurement by making it fully \ntransparent, inclusive and efficient. MSMEs have an opportunity to sell \ntheir products through GeM. Transactions of over ` 17,500 crore have \ntaken place, resulting in average savings of 25-28%. The GeM platform is \nnow being extended to all CPSEs. \n45. We have focussed on supporting domestic trade and services. Our \nGovernment has recently assigned the subject of \u201cpromotion of internal \ntrade including retail trading and welfare of traders, and their employees\u201d \nto the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, which will now be \nrenamed as the Department for Promotion of Industries and Internal \nTrade. \nStrengthening Defence and National Security \n46. Madam Speaker, our soldiers protect our borders in tough \nconditions. They are our pride and honour. We also respected their dignity. \nIn our Election Manifesto, we had promised to implement One Rank One \nPension (OROP). This was pending for the last 40 years and has been  \nresolved by us.  The previous Governments announced it in three budgets \nbut sanctioned a mere ` 500 crore in 2014-15 Interim Budget; in contrast \nwe have already  disbursed over ` 35,000 crore after implementing the \nScheme in its' true spirit. The Government also announced substantial hike \nin the Military Service Pay (MSP) of all service personnel and special \nallowances given to Naval and Air Force personnel deployed in high risk \nduties. \n47. Our Defence Budget will be crossing ` 3,00,000 crore for the first time \nin 2019 -20. For securing our borders and to maintain preparedness of the \nhighest order, if necessary, additional funds would be provided. \nSupporting Indians across the world \n48. Today, all persons of Indian origin feel secure that their \nmotherland Bharat cares for them and at times of need will support \nthem. India\u2019s transformation has inculcated a sense of pride and respect \nfor Indians and persons of Indian origin across the globe. We have taken \nseveral initiatives to strengthen their connect with India, facilitate their \ninvestment in India and ease their travel. \nInfrastructure development  \n49. Infrastructure is the backbone of any nation\u2019s development and \nquality of life. Whether it is highways or railways or airways or even digi-12 \n \n \nways, we have gone beyond incremental growth to attain transformative \nachievements.  \n50. Because of 'UDAAN Scheme', t oday an ordinary citizen is also travelling \nby air. The number  of operational airports has crossed 100 with the \ncommissioning of the Pakyong airport in Sikkim. Domestic passenger traffic \nhas doubled during the  last five years leading to large number of jobs \nbeing created also.  Today, India is the fastest highway developer in the \nworld with 27 kms of highways built each day. Projects stuck for decades \nlike the Eastern Peripheral Highway around Delhi or the Bogibeel rail-cum-\nroad bridge in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh have been completed. The \nflagship programme of Sagarmala along  the coastal areas of the country \nwill develop ports for faster handling of import and export cargo. For the \nfirst time, container freight movement has started on inland waterways \nfrom Kolkata to Varanasi. Our Government will introduce container cargo \nmovement to the North East as well, by improving the navigation capacity \nof the Brahmaputra river. \n51. Indian Railways has experienced the safest year in its history. All \nUnmanned Level Crossings on broad gauge network have  been eliminated. \nIntroduction of the  first indigenously developed and manufactured  semi \nhigh-speed \"Vande  Bharat Express\" will give the Indian passengers world \nclass experience with speed, service and safety. This major leap in wholly \ndeveloped technology by our engineers will give an impetus to the Make \nin India programme and create jobs. Capital support from the budget for \nrailways is proposed at ` 64,587 crore in 2019-20 (BE).  The Railways\u2019 \noverall capital expenditure programme is of ` 1,58,658 crore. The \nOperating Ratio is expected to improve from 98.4% in 2017-18 to 96.2% \nin 2018-19 (RE) and further to 95% in 2019-20 (BE). \n52. India provided leadership to the  global effort to address the \nproblem of climate change. Our commitment to promote renewable \nenergy is reflected in setting up the International Solar Alliance, the first \ntreaty based international inter-governmental organisation headquartered \nin India. India\u2019s installed solar generation capacity has grown over ten \ntimes in last  five years.  This sector is now creating lakhs of new age \njobs.  \n53. India's import dependence on crude oil and natural gas has been a \nsource of big concern to our Government. While we have taken a large number \nof measures to moderate the increasing demand through usage of bio fuel and \nalternate technologies, urgent action is needed to increase hydrocarbon 13 \n \n \nproduction to reduce imports.  A high level Inter -Ministerial Committee, \nconstituted by our Government, has made several specific recommendations, \nincluding transforming the system of bidding for exploration, changing from  \nrevenue sharing to exploration programme for Category II and III basins. The \nGovernment is in the process of implementing these recommendations. \n54. The people of North East have also received significant benefits of \ninfrastructure development. Arunachal Pradesh came on the air map \nrecently and Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram have come on India\u2019s rail \nmap for the first time. Allocation for the North Eastern Areas is being \nproposed to be increased by 21% to ` 58,166 crore in 2019 -20 BE over \n2018-19 BE.    \nDigital India Revolution \n55. Madam Speaker, India is now leading the world in the \nconsumption of mobile data. Monthly consumption of mobile data \nincreased by over  50 times in the  last five years. The cost of data and \nvoice calls in India is now possibly the lowest in the world. Today, under \nMake in India, mobile and parts  manufacturing companies have increased \nfrom 2 to more than 268 providing huge job opportunities. More than 3 \nlakh Common Service Centres (CSCs) employing about 12 lakh people,  are \ndigitally delivering several services to the citizens. The Common Service \nCentres are expanding their services and also creating digital infrastructure in \nthe villages, including connectivity, to convert the villages into Digital Villages. \nThe Governm ent will make 1 lakh villages into Digital Villages over next five \nyears. \n56. Jan Dhan -Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) and Direct Benefit Transfer have \nbeen game changers. Bank nationalisation was first done 50 years ago, \nbut a large part of the country was still left  out of the economic \nmainstream with no access to formal banking. In the last five years, \nnearly 34 crore Jan Dhan bank accounts were opened. Aadhaar is now \nnear universally implemented. This has helped ensure the poor and \nmiddle class receive the benefits of Government schemes directly in their \nbank accounts by eliminating middlemen.  \nEntertainment \n57. Entertainment industry is a major employment generator. To \npromote entertainment industry - Single window clearance for ease of \nshooting films,  available only to foreigners, is now going to be made \navailable to Indian filmmakers as well. Regulatory provisions will rely more 14 \n \n \non self-declaration. We will also introduce anti-camcording provisions in \nthe Cinematograph Act to control the menace of piracy. \nSimplification of Direct Tax System to benefit Tax-payers   \n58. Madam Speaker, for making the life of our direct tax-payers easy, \nwe reduced tax rates, more  for the common man and middle class, and \nmade the interface with the tax department much simpler and largely \nfaceless. Due to this, the tax collections increased significantly from  ` 6.38 \nLakh crore in 2013-14 to almost  ` 12 lakh crore this year.  The number \nof returns filed have also increased from 3.79 crore to 6.85 crore showing \n80% growth in tax base.  I thank the honest taxpayers of India for \nreposing faith in our Government. Let me assure them that we have used \ntheir contribution to serve the poor and create better infrastructure.  \n59. The Income Tax  Department now functions online. Returns, \nassessments, refunds and queries are all undertaken online.  Last year, \n99.54% of the income-tax returns were accepted as they were filed. Our \nGovernment has now approved a path breaking, technology  intensive \nproject to transform the Income-tax Department into a more  assessee-\nfriendly one. All returns will be processed in twenty-four hours and \nrefunds issued simultaneously.  Within the next two years, almost all \nverification and assessment of returns selected for scrutiny will be done  \nelectronically through anonymised back office, manned by tax experts and \nofficials, without any personal interface between taxpayers and tax officers.  \n60. Reducing the tax  burden on middle class has always been our \npriority ever since our Government took over in 2014.  We increased the \nbasic exemption limit from ` 2 lakh to ` 2.5 Lakh and gave tax rebate so \nthat no tax was payable by persons having income up to ` 3 lakh. We \nalso reduced the tax rate from 10% to 5% for the tax slab of ` 2.5 lakh to \n` 5 lakh and introduced Standard Deduction of ` 40,000 for the  salaried \nclass.  Deduction of savings under section 80C was increased from  \n` 1 lakh to ` 1.5 lakh. Deduction of interest for self-occupied house \nproperty was raised from ` 1.5 lakh to ` 2 lakh. \n61. Special benefits and incentives were also given to small businesses \nand start-ups. Overall compliance processes were simplified. Threshold \nlimit for presumptive taxation of business was raised from \n` 1 crore to ` 2 crore. The benefit of presumptive taxation was extended \nfor the first time to small professionals fixing threshold limit at ` 50 lakh. \nIn order to promote a less cash economy, the presumptive profit rate has \nbeen reduced from 8% to 6%.  The tax rate for companies with turnover 15 \n \n \nof up to ` 250 crore, covering almost 99% of the companies, was reduced \nto 25% which was also applicable to new manufacturing companies \nwithout any turnover limits.    \nGST Reform for benefit to consumers and businesses \n62. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms lingered on during the \nprevious Government for almost a decade. Our Government implemented \nthe GST, which is undoubtedly the biggest taxation reform undertaken \nsince Independence. Seventeen different taxes levied by the Central and \nState/UT Governments with cascading effect of tax on tax, were \nconsolidated into one GST.  India became a common market. GST has \nresulted in increased tax base, higher collections and ease of trade. This \nwill reduce the interface between the tax payer and the Government for \nday-to-day operations and assessments.   Now returns are fully online and \ne-way bill system is in place. Inter-state movements have become faster, \nmore efficient, and hassle free with no Entry Tax, check posts, and truck \nqueues.   \n63. The high taxation levied on multiple commodities in the pre-GST \nregime has been rationalised and the burden on the consumer, especially \nthe poor and the middle class, has been significantly reduced.  The GST \nCouncil, comprising the Centre and States/UTs, finalised the GST rates \ncollectively mostly  lower than pre-GST rates. Since then, GST has been  \ncontinuously reduced providing relief of about ` 80,000 crore annually to \nconsumers. Most items of daily use of the poor and middle class are now \nin the 0% or 5% tax slab.  Cinema goers who were subjected to multiple \ntaxes up to 50% are mostly paying much lower tax at  12% now. Our \nGovernment wants the  GST burden on home buyers to be reduced  and \naccordingly we have  moved the GST Council to appoint a Group of \nMinisters to examine and make recommendations in this regard at the \nearliest.  \n64. GST aims to benefit small traders, manufacturers and service \nproviders.  Exemptions from GST for small businesses has been doubled \nfrom ` 20 lakh to ` 40 lakh.  Further, small businesses having turnover up \nto ` 1.5 crore have been given an attractive composition scheme wherein \nthey pay only 1% flat rate and have to file  one annual return only.  \nSimilarly, small service providers with turnover upto `50 lakhs can now opt \nfor composition scheme and pay GST at 6% instead of 18%. More than 35 \nlakh small traders, manufacturers and service providers will benefit from \nthese trader friendly measures. Soon, businesses comprising over 90% of \nGST payers will be allowed to file quarterly return. 16 \n \n \n65. In spite of such major rate reductions and relaxations, revenue \ntrends are encouraging. The average monthly tax collection in the current \nyear is ` 97,100 crore per month as compared to ` 89,700 crore per \nmonth in the first year. The State revenues are improving with \nguaranteed 14% annual revenue increase for the first five years.  \nCustoms and Trading Across Border Reforms  \n66. To promote the  \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, we have undertaken \nrationalization of customs duties and  procedures. Our Government has \nabolished duties on 36 capital goods. A revised system of importing duty-\nfree capital goods and inputs for manufacture and export has been \nintroduced, along with introduction of single point of approval under \nsection 65 of the Customs Act. Indian Customs is introducing full and \ncomprehensive digitalization of export/import transactions and leveraging \nRFID technology to improve export logistics.   \nDemonetisation and Drive against Black Money \n67. Our Government is committed to eliminating the ills of black \nmoney from our country. The anti-black money measures taken by us \nduring the last four and half years in the form of Black Money  Law, the \nFugitive Criminal Offenders Act, and Demonetisation, have  brought  \nundisclosed income of about  ` 1,30,000 crore to tax, led to seizure and \nattachment of assets worth approximately ` 50,000 crore, and  compelled \nholders of large cash currency to disclose their source of earnings. During \nthis period, Benami assets worth ` 6,900 crore and foreign assets worth \n`1,600 crore have been attached. As many as 3,38,000 shell companies \nhave been  detected and  de-registered, and  their directors  disqualified.  \nGrowth of 18% in direct tax collection in 2017-18 and increase in tax \nbase by as many as 1.06 crore people filing income tax returns for the \nfirst time in FY 2017-18 is mainly on account of demonetization.  \nVision for the next Decade \n68. Madam Speaker, the NDA Government headed by Hon'ble  Prime \nMinister Shri Narendra Modi has laid the foundation for India\u2019s growth \nand development for times to come. We have resolved many problems \nwhich were coming in the way of realising our full potential as a society \nand an economy. We are poised to become a Five Trillion Dollar Economy \nin the next five years and aspire to become a Ten Trillion Dollar Economy \nin the next 8 years thereafter. 17 \n \n \n69. In the Indian ethos, anything which is good is supposed to bestow, \ncause, create and do good in all ten directions. I will, therefore, layout our \nvision for ten most important dimensions in 2030. \n70. The First Dimension of this Vision will be to build physical as well \nas social infrastructure for a ten Trillion Dollar economy and to provide  \nease of living. It will comprise next generation infrastructure of roads, \nrailways, seaports, airports, urban transport, gas and electric transmission \nand inland waterways. On the social infrastructure side, every family will \nhave a roof on its head and will live in a healthy, clean and wholesome \nenvironment. We will also build a quality, science oriented educational system \nwith Institutes of Excellence providing leadership at the top.  \n71. The Second dimension of our Vision is to create a Digital India \nreaching every sector of the  economy, every corner of the country and \nimpacting the life of all Indians. Digital Infrastructure and digital economy \nof 2030 will be built upon the successes achieved in recent years in \ndigitisation of Government processes and private transactions. Our youth \nwill lead us in this endeavour with innumerable start-ups creating digital \nIndia, and millions of jobs in this eco-system. \n72.  Making India a pollution free nation with green Mother Earth and \nblue skies is the Third Dimension of our Vision. This India will drive on \nElectric Vehicles with Renewables becoming a major source of energy \nsupply. India will lead the world in the transport revolution through \nelectric vehicles and energy storage devices, bringing down import -\ndependence and ensuring energy security for our people. \n73. Expanding rural industrialisation using modern digital technologies \nto generate massive employment is the Fourth Dimension of our Vision. \nThis will be built upon the Make in India approach to develop grass-roots \nlevel clusters, structures and mechanisms encompassing the MSMEs, \nvillage industries and start-ups spread in every nook and corner of the \ncountry. India is now on the way to becoming a global manufacturing hub \nin various sectors including automobiles and electronics, defence and \nmedical devices.  \n74. Our rivers and water bodies are our life supporting assets. Our \nGovernment has worked vigorously for cleaning River Ganga. Fifth \nDimension of our Vision for India of 2030 is Clean Rivers, with safe \ndrinking water to all Indians, sustaining and nourishing life and efficient \nuse of water in irrigation using micro-irrigation techniques.  18 \n \n \n75.  India\u2019s long coastline has the potential of becoming the strength \nof the economy, particularly through exploitation of the Blue Economy, to \nensure better standards and quality of life for a large number of people \nliving in the coastal areas. Our efforts in the Sagarmala programme will be \nscaled up and we will develop other inland waterways faster. Our \ncoastline and our ocean waters powering India\u2019s development and growth \nis the Sixth Dimension of our Vision. \n76. The Seventh Dimension of our Vision aims at the outer skies. Our \nspace programme \u2013 Gaganyaan, India becoming the launch-pad of \nsatellites for the World and placing an Indian astronaut into space by \n2022 reflect this dimension of our vision. \n77. Making India self-sufficient in food, exporting to the world to meet \ntheir food needs and producing food in the most organic way is the \nEighth Dimension of our Vision. High farm production and productivity will \nbe achieved through modern agricultural practices and value addition.  An \nintegrated approach towards agro and food processing, preservation, \npackaging and maintenance of the cold chain will be  our focus of \nattention.  \n78. A healthy India is the Ninth Dimension of our Vision. We will be \naiming at healthy society with an  environment of health assurance and the \nsupport of necessary health infrastructure. Our Government has rolled out \nthe Ayushman Bharat scheme. By 2030, we will work towards a distress \nfree health care and a functional and comprehensive wellness system for \nall. Such a healthy India built with the participation of women having equal \nrights and concern for their safety and empowerment. \n79. Our Vision can be delivered by Team India - our employees \nworking together with the elected  Government, transforming India into a \nMinimum Government Maximum Governance nation.  This is the Tenth \nDimension. Our India of 2030 will have a proactive and responsible \nbureaucracy which will be viewed as friendly to people. \n80. With this comprehensive ten-dimensional Vision, we will create an \nIndia where poverty, malnutrition, littering and illiteracy would be a \nmatter of the past. India would be a modern, technology driven, high \ngrowth, equitable and transparent society.  19 \n \n \nThe Fiscal Programme for 2019-20 and beyond \n81. The estimate of incomes and expenditure which I am presenting \ntoday, pegs the fiscal deficit of year 2019-20 at 3.4% of GDP. We would \nhave maintained fiscal deficit at 3.3% for year 2018 -19 and taken further steps \nto consolidate fiscal deficit in year 2019 -20. However, considering the need for  \nincome support to farmers we have provided ` 20,000 crore in 2018-19 RE and \n` 75,000 crore in 2019 -20 BE. If we exclude this,  the fiscal deficit would have \nbeen less than 3.3% for 2018-19 and less than 3.1% for year 2019-20.  \n82. Total expenditure rises from ` 24,57,235 crore in 2018-19 RE to \n`27,84,200 crore in 2019-20 BE, a rise of `3,26,965 crore or \napproximately 13.30%. This reflect a high increase considering low inflation. \nCapital Expenditure for 2019-20 BE is estimated to be ` 3,36,292 crore. \nCentrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are proposed to be allocated `3,27,679  \ncrore in BE 2019-20 as against ` 3,04,849 crore in 2018 -19 RE.  Allocation \nfor National Education Mission is being increased from ` 32,334 crore in \nRE 2018-19 to ` 38,572 crore in BE 2019-20. Allocation for Integrated \nChild Development Scheme (ICDS) is being increased from ` 23,357 crore \nin RE 2018-19 to ` 27,584 crore in BE 2019-20.  \n83. A substantial increase  is proposed in the allocation for welfare of \nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The allocation of ` 56,619 crore \nmade in BE of 2018-19 for Scheduled Caste, further increased  to ` 62,474 \ncrore in RE is proposed to be enhanced to ` 76,801 crore in BE for 2019-\n20, an increase of 35.6% over BE of 2018-19. For the Scheduled Tribes \nalso, proposed allocation in 2019-20 BE is ` 50,086 crore as against \n`39,135 crore in BE 2018-19, an increase of 28%. \n84. We have pursued the public enterprises asset management agenda \nto make these enterprises accountable to the people.  As many as 57 \nCPSEs are now listed with total  market capitalisation of over ` 13 lakh \ncrore. The  Government received over ` 1 lakh crore from disinvestment \nproceeds during 2017 -18. We are confident of crossing the target of \n`80,000 crore this year.  \n85. We have maintained the  glide path towards our target  of 3% of \nfiscal deficit to be achieved by 2020-21. India\u2019s Debt to GDP ratio was \n46.5% in year  2017-18.  The FRBM Act prescribes that the Debt to GDP \nratio of the Government of India should be brought down to 40% by \n2024-25. Along with completion of the fiscal deficit consolidation \nprogramme, we will now focus on Debt consolidation. 20 \n \n \n86. Our Government  had promised last year that we will carry  out \nreforms in stamp duty levied and collected on financial securities \ntransactions. I am proposing, through the Finance Bill, necessary \namendments in this regard. The amendments proposed would usher in a \nvery streamlined system. Stamp duties would be levied on one instrument \nrelating to one transaction and get collected at one place through the  \nStock Exchanges. The duty so collected will be shared with the State \nGovernments seamlessly on the basis of domicile of buying client.  \n  21 \n \n \n \nPART B:  \nTax Proposals \n87. On behalf of all the people of India and our Government, I would  first  \nlike to thank all our taxpayers for their valuable  contribution to nation building \nand for providing a better life to the poor and marginalized sections of society. \nYour tax helps provide dignity to our sisters and mothers with  toilets and \ncooking gas c onnections. Your tax pays for the electricity connections to the \npoor who lived in darkness for generations. The tax you pay will provide health \ncare to 50 crore brothers and sisters, and children. It is you  who is  ensuring \nrespect, dignity, and a secure  future to our retired jawans through One Rank \nOne Pension. Thank you, taxpayers. \n88. Because of major tax reforms undertaken by us during the last four and \nhalf years, both tax collections as well as the tax base have shown significant \nincrease and we have ma de progress towards achieving a  moderate taxation \u2013\nhigh compliance regime. It is, therefore, just and fair that some benefits from \nthe tax reforms must also be passed on to the middle class taxpayers. Keeping \nthis in view, I propose to further reduce  the tax burden on such taxpayers. \nThough as per convention, the main tax proposals will be presented in the \nregular budget, small taxpayers especially middle class, salary earners, \npensioners, and senior citizens need certainty in their minds at the beginning \nof the year about their taxes. Therefore, proposals, particularly relating to such \nclass of persons should not wait.    Hence, while for the present the existing \nrates of income tax will continue for FY 2019-20, I propose the following: \n   \n89.    Individual taxpayers having taxable annual income up to ` 5 lakhs will \nget full tax rebate and therefore will not be required to pay any income tax. As \na result, even persons having   gross income up to ` 6.50 lakhs may not be \nrequired to pay any income tax if they mak e investments in provident funds, \nspecified savings, insurance etc. In fact, with additional deductions such as \ninterest on home loan up to ` 2 lakh, interest on education loans, National \nPension Scheme contributions, medical insurance, medical expenditure  on \nsenior citizens etc, persons having even higher income will not have to pay any \ntax. This will provide tax benefit of ` 18,500 crore to an estimated 3 crore \nmiddle class  taxpayers comprising self employed, small business, small \ntraders, salary earners, pensioners and senior citizens. 22 \n \n \n90. For salaried persons, Standard Deduction is being raised from the \ncurrent ` 40,000 to ` 50,000. This will provide additional tax benefit of  \n` 4,700 crore to more than 3 crore salary earners and pensioners.  \n91. Currently, income tax on notional rent is payable if one has more than \none self-occupied house. Considering the  difficulty of the middle class having \nto maintain families at two locations on account of their job, children\u2019s \neducation, care of parents etc. I am proposing to exempt levy of  income tax on \nnotional rent on a second self-occupied house.  \n92. TDS threshold on interest earned  on bank/post office deposits is being \nraised from ` 10,000 to ` 40,000. This will  benefit small depositors and non -\nworking spouses. Further, t he TDS threshold for deduction of tax on rent is \nproposed to be increased from ` 1,80,000 to ` 2,40,000 for providing relief to \nsmall taxpayers. \n93.  The benefit of rollover of capital gains under section 54 of the Income \nTax Act will be increased from investm ent in one residential house to two \nresidential houses  for a tax payer having  capital gains  up to ` 2 crore. This \nbenefit can be availed once in a life time.  \n94. For making more homes available under affordable housing, the \nbenefits under  Section 80-IBA of the Income Tax Act is being extended for one \nmore year, i.e. to the housing projects approved till 31st March, 2020. \n95. Also, for giving impetus to the real estate sector, I have proposed to \nextend the period of exemption from levy of tax on notional rent, on unsold \ninventories, from one year to two years, from the end of the year in which the \nproject is completed.  \nConcluding Remarks \n96. Madam Speaker, This is not merely an Interim Budget , but a medium of \nthe country's development journey . All the transformation that we are \nwitnessing, is because of the passion of the people of our nation . The credit \ngoes to them  only. Development has become a mass -movement during the \nperiod of our Government. \n97. We will transform India into a leading nation of the world with the help \nof our people. We, along  with them have laid the foundation. A grand edifice \nwill be erected with their support. We have given a decisive leadership, whose \nintent is clear, policy is transparent and integrity is resolute.  \n98. With this, I commend the Budget to this august House. ",
