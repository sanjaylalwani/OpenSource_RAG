At the outset, I want to take a moment to express my empathy for \nthose who had to bear adverse health and economic effects of the \npandemic.  \n2. The overall, sharp rebound and recovery of the economy is reflective \nof our country\u2019s strong resilience. India\u2019s economic growth in the current \nyear is estimated to be 9.2 per cent, highest among all large economies.  \n3. I recognise we are in the midst of an Omicron wave, with high \nincidence, but milder symptoms. Further, the speed and coverage of our \nvaccination campaign has helped greatly. With the accelerated \nimprovement of health infrastructure in the past two years, we are in a \nstrong position to withstand challenges.  I am confident that with Sabka \nPrayas we will continue our journey of strong growth. \n4. Hon\u2019ble Speaker, we are marking Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav , and \nhave entered into Amrit Kaal , the 25-year-long leadup to India@100.  \nHon\u2019ble Prime Minister in his Independence Day address had set-out the \nvision for India@100.   \n5. By achieving certain goals during the Amrit Kaal, our government \naims to attain the vision. They are: \n\uf0b7 Complementing the macro-economic level growth focus with a \nmicro-economic level all-inclusive welfare focus, 2 \n \n \n \n\uf0b7 Promoting digital economy & fintech, technology enabled \ndevelopment, energy transition, and climate action, and \n\uf0b7 Relying on virtuous cycle starting from private investment with \npublic capital investment helping to crowd-in private \ninvestment. \n6. Since 2014 our government\u2019s focus has been on empowerment of \ncitizens, especially the poor and the marginalised. Measures have included \nprogrammes that have provided housing, electricity, cooking gas, and \naccess to water. We also have programmes for ensuring financial inclusion \nand direct benefit transfers. We are committed to strengthening the \nabilities of the poor to tap all opportunities. Our government constantly \nstrives to provide the necessary ecosystem for the middle classes \u2013 a vast \nand wide section which is populated across various middle-income brackets \n\u2013 to make use of the opportunities they so desire.  \n7. This Budget seeks to lay the foundation and give a blueprint to steer \nthe economy over the Amrit Kaal of the next 25 years \u2013 from India at 75 to \nIndia at 100. It continues to build on the vision drawn in the Budget of 2021-\n22. Its fundamental tenets, which included transparency of financial \nstatement and fiscal position, reflect the government\u2019s intent, strengths, \nand challenges. This continues to guide us. \n8. The initiatives of the last year\u2019s Budget have seen significant \nprogress and have been provided with adequate allocations in this Budget \nas well.  \n9. The strengthening of health infrastructure, speedy implementation \nof the vaccination programme, and the nation-wide resilient response to \nthe current wave of the pandemic, are evident for all.  \n10. The Productivity Linked Incentive in 14 sectors for achieving the \nvision of AtmaNirbhar Bharat has received excellent response, with \npotential to create 60 lakh new jobs, and an additional production of ` 30 \nlakh crore during next 5 years.  \n11. Towards implementation of the new Public Sector Enterprise policy, \nthe strategic transfer of ownership of Air India has been completed. The \nstrategic partner for NINL (Neelanchal Ispat Nigam Limited) has been \nselected. The public issue of the LIC is expected shortly. Others too are in \nthe process for 2022-23.  3 \n \n \n \n12. The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development \n(NaBFID) and National Asset Reconstruction Company have commenced \ntheir activities.    \n13. Hon'ble Speaker sir, Budget 2021 -22 had provided a sha rp increase \nin provision for public investment or capital expenditure. Throughout the \nyear, with the Hon 'ble Prime Minister, guiding the implementation, our \neconomic recovery is continuing to benefit from the multiplier effect.  \n14. This Budget continues to provide impetus for growth. It lays a \nparallel track of (1) a blueprint for the Amrit Kaal , which is futuristic and \ninclusive. This will directly benefit our youth, women, farmers, the \nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. And  (2) big public investment \nfor modern infrastructure, readying for India at 100.

Once a consensus is reached among the beneficiary states, the \nCentre will provide support for implementation. \nFood Processing \n38. For farmers to adopt suitable varieties of fruits and vegetables, and \nto use appropriate production and harvesting techniques, our government \nwill provide a comprehensive package with participation of state \ngovernments.  \nMSME \n39. Udyam, e-Shram, NCS and ASEEM portals will be interlinked. Their \nscope will be widened. They will now perform as portals with live, organic \ndatabases, providing G2C, B2C and B2B services. These services will relate \nto credit facilitation, skilling, and recruitment with an aim to further \nformalise the economy and enhance entrepreneurial opportunities for all.   \n40. Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) has provided \nmuch-needed additional credit to more than 130 lakh MSMEs. This has \nhelped them mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic. The hospitality \nand related services, especially those by micro and small enterprises, are \nyet to regain their pre-pandemic level of business. Considering these \naspects, the ECLGS will be extended up to March 2023 and its guarantee \ncover will be expanded by ` 50,000 crore to total cover of ` 5 lakh crore, \nwith the additional amount being earmarked exclusively for the hospitality \nand related enterprises.  \n41.

Due to the pandemic-induced closure of schools, our children, \nparticularly in the rural areas, and those from Scheduled Castes and \nScheduled Tribes, and other weaker sections, have lost almost 2 years of \nformal education. Mostly, these are children in government schools. We \nrecognise the need to impart supplementary teaching and to build a \nresilient mechanism for education delivery. For this purpose, \u2018one class-one \nTV channel\u2019 programme of PM eVIDYA will be expanded from 12 to 200 TV \nchannels. This will enable all states to provide supplementary education in \nregional languages for classes 1-12.  \n47.

A Digital University will be established to provide access to students \nacross the country for world-class quality universal education with \npersonalised learning experience at their doorsteps. This will be made \navailable in different Indian languages and ICT formats. The University will \nbe built on a networked hub-spoke model, with the hub building cutting \nedge ICT expertise. The best public universities and institutions in the \ncountry will collaborate as a network of hub-spokes.  \n 9 \n \n \n \nAyushman Bharat Digital Mission \n51. An open platform, for the National Digital Health Ecosystem will be \nrolled out. It will consist of digital registries of health providers and health \nfacilities, unique health identity, consent framework, and universal access \nto health facilities.  \nNational Tele Mental Health Programme  \n52. The pandemic has accentuated mental health problems in people of \nall ages. To better the access to quality mental health counselling and care \nservices, a \u2018National Tele Mental Health Programme\u2019 will be launched. This \nwill include a network of 23 tele-mental health centres of excellence, with \nNIMHANS being the nodal centre and International Institute of Information \nTechnology-Bangalore (IIITB) providing technology support.   \nMission Shakti, Mission Vatsalya, Saksham Anganwadi & Poshan 2.0 \n53. Recognizing the importance of Nari Shakti  as the harbinger of our \nbright future and for women-led development during the Amrit Kaal , our \ngovernment has comprehensively revamped the schemes of the Ministry of \nWomen & Child Development.  Accordingly, three schemes, namely, \nMission Shakti, Mission Vatsalya, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 were  \nlaunched recently to provide integrated benefits to women and \nchildren.

The Central Government will work with the state governments for \nreduction of time required for all land and construction related approvals, \nfor promoting affordable housing for middle class and Economically Weaker 10 \n \n \n \nSections in urban areas. We shall also work with the financial sector \nregulators to expand access to capital along with reduction in cost of \nintermediation. \nPrime Minister\u2019s Development Initiative for North East Region (PM-\nDevINE) \n57. A new scheme, Prime Minister\u2019s Development Initiative for North-\nEast, PM-DevINE, will be implemented through the North-Eastern Council. It \nwill fund infrastructure, in the spirit of PM GatiShakti, and social \ndevelopment projects based on felt needs of the North-East. This will \nenable livelihood activities for youth and women, filling the gaps in various \nsectors. It will not be a substitute for existing central or state schemes. \nWhile the central ministries may also pose their candidate projects, priority \nwill be given to those posed by the states. An initial allocation of ` 1,500 \ncrore will be made, and the initial list of projects is given in Annexure-1.  \nAspirational Blocks Programme \n58. Our vision to improve the quality of life of citizens in the most \nbackward districts of the country through Aspirational Districts Programme \nhas been translated into reality in a short span of time. 95 per cent of those \n112 districts have made significant progress in key sectors such as health, \nnutrition, financial inclusion and basic infrastructure. They have surpassed \nthe state average values. However, in those districts, some blocks continue \nto lag. In 2022-23, the programme will focus on such blocks in those \ndistricts.    \nVibrant Villages Programme  \n59. Border villages with sparse population, limited connectivity and \ninfrastructure often get left out from the development gains. Such villages \non the northern border will be covered under the new Vibrant Villages \nProgramme. The activities will include construction of village infrastructure, \nhousing, tourist centres, road connectivity, provisioning of decentralized \nrenewable energy, direct to home access for Doordarshan and educational \nchannels, and support for livelihood generation. Additional funding for \nthese activities will be provided. Existing schemes will be converged. We will \ndefine their outcomes and monitor them on a constant basis. \nAnytime \u2013 Anywhere Post Office Savings \n60. In 2022, 100 per cent of 1.5 lakh post offices will come on the core \nbanking system enabling financial inclusion and access to accounts through 11 \n \n \n \nnet banking, mobile banking, ATMs, and also provide online transfer of \nfunds between post office accounts and bank accounts. This will be helpful, \nespecially for farmers and senior citizens in rural areas, enabling inter-\noperability and financial inclusion.  \nDigital Banking  \n61. In recent years, digital banking, digital payments and fintech \ninnovations have grown at a rapid pace in the country. Government is \ncontinuously encouraging these sectors to ensure that the benefits of digital \nbanking reach every nook and corner of the country in a consumer-friendly \nmanner. Taking forward this agenda, and to mark 75 years of our \nindependence, it is proposed to set up 75 Digital Banking Units (DBUs) in 75 \ndistricts of the country by Scheduled Commercial Banks.  \nDigital Payments  \n62. The financial support for digital payment ecosystem announced in \nthe previous Budget will continue in 2022-23. This will encourage further \nadoption of digital payments. There will also be a focus to promote use of \npayment platforms that are economical and user friendly. \nProductivity Enhancement & Investment, Sunrise Opportunities, Energy \nTransition, and Climate Action \nProductivity Enhancement & Investment \nEase of Doing Business 2.0 & Ease of Living \n63. In recent years, over 25,000 compliances were reduced and 1486 \nUnion laws were repealed. This is the result of our government\u2019s strong \ncommitment for \u2018minimum government & maximum governance\u2019, our trust \nin the public, and ease of doing business (EODB). \n64. For the Amrit Kaal, the next phase of Ease of Doing Business EODB \n2.0 and Ease of Living, will be launched. In our endeavour to improve \nproductive efficiency of capital and human resources, we will follow the \nidea of \u2018trust-based governance\u2019. \n65. This new phase will be guided by an active involvement of the \nstates, digitisation of manual processes and interventions, integration of the \ncentral and state-level systems through IT bridges, a single point access for \nall citizen-centric services, and a standardization and removal of \noverlapping compliances. Crowdsourcing of suggestions and ground level 12 \n \n \n \nassessment of the impact with active involvement of citizens and businesses \nwill be encouraged.  \nGreen Clearances \n66. A single window portal, PARIVESH, for all green clearances was \nlaunched in 2018. It has been instrumental in reducing the time required for \napprovals significantly. The scope of this portal will now be expanded, to \nprovide information to the applicants. Based on location of units, \ninformation about specific approvals will be provided. It will enable \napplication for all four approvals through a single form, and tracking of the \nprocess through Centralized Processing Centre-Green (CPC-Green). \ne-Passport \n67. The issuance of e-Passports using embedded chip and futuristic \ntechnology will be rolled out in 2022-23 to enhance convenience for the \ncitizens in their overseas travel.  \nUrban Development \n68. By the time of India @ 100, nearly half our population is likely to be \nliving in urban areas. To prepare for this, orderly urban development is of \ncritical importance. This will help realize the country\u2019s economic potential, \nincluding livelihood opportunities for the demographic dividend. For this, on \nthe one hand we need to nurture the megacities and their hinterlands to \nbecome current centres of economic growth. On the other hand, we need \nto facilitate tier 2 and 3 cities to take on the mantle in the future. This \nwould require us to reimagine our cities into centres of sustainable living \nwith opportunities for all, including women and youth. For this to happen, \nurban planning cannot continue with a business-as-usual approach. We plan \nto steer a paradigm change.     \n69. A high-level committee of reputed urban planners, urban \neconomists and institutions will be formed to make recommendations on \nurban sector policies, capacity building, planning, implementation and \ngovernance. \nUrban Planning Support to States \n70. For urban capacity building, support will be provided to the states. \nModernization of building byelaws, Town Planning Schemes (TPS), and \nTransit Oriented Development (TOD) will be implemented. This will \nfacilitate reforms for people to live and work closer to mass transit systems. 13 \n \n \n \nThe Central Government\u2019s financial support for mass transit projects and \nAMRUT scheme will be leveraged for formulation of action plans and their \nimplementation for facilitating TOD and TPS by the states.   \n71. For developing India specific knowledge in urban planning and \ndesign, and to deliver certified training in these areas, up to five existing \nacademic institutions in different regions will be designated as centres of \nexcellence. These centres will be provided endowment funds of ` 250 crore \neach. In addition, AICTE will take the lead to improve syllabi, quality and \naccess of urban planning courses in other institutions. \nClean & Sustainable Mobility \n72. We will promote a shift to use of public transport in urban areas. \nThis will be complemented by clean tech and governance solutions, special \nmobility zones with zero fossil-fuel policy, and EV vehicles. \nBattery Swapping Policy  \n73. Considering the constraint of space in urban areas for setting up \ncharging stations at scale, a battery swapping policy will be brought out and \ninter-operability standards will be formulated. The private sector will be \nencouraged to develop sustainable and innovative business models for \n\u2018Battery or Energy as a Service\u2019. This will improve efficiency in the EV eco-\nsystem.  \nLand Records Management  \n74. Efficient use of land resources is a strong imperative. States will be \nencouraged to adopt Unique Land Parcel Identification Number to facilitate \nIT-based management of records. The facility for transliteration of land \nrecords across any of the Schedule VIII languages will also be rolled out. \n75. The adoption or linkage with National Generic Document \nRegistration System (NGDRS) with the \u2018One-Nation One-Registration \nSoftware\u2019 will be promoted as an option for uniform process for registration \nand \u2018anywhere registration\u2019 of deeds & documents.  \nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Code \n76. Necessary amendments in the Code will be carried out to enhance \nthe efficacy of the resolution process and facilitate cross border insolvency \nresolution. \n 14 \n \n \n \nAccelerated Corporate Exit \n77. Several IT-based systems have been established for accelerated \nregistration of new companies. Now the Centre for Processing Accelerated \nCorporate Exit (C-PACE) with process re-engineering, will be established to \nfacilitate and speed up the voluntary winding-up of these companies from \nthe currently required 2 years to less than 6 months.      \nGovernment Procurement \n78. Government rules have recently been modernized for the needs the \nAmrit Kaal . The new rules have benefitted from the inputs from various \nstakeholders. The modernised rules allow use of transparent quality criteria \nbesides cost in evaluation of complex tenders. Provisions have been made \nfor payment of 75 per cent of running bills, mandatorily within 10 days and \nfor encouraging settlement of disputes through conciliation. \n79. As a further step to enhance transparency and to reduce delays in \npayments, a completely paperless, end-to-end online e-Bill System will be \nlaunched for use by all central ministries for their procurements. The \nsystem will enable the suppliers and contractors to submit online their \ndigitally signed bills and claims and track their status from anywhere.  \n80. To reduce indirect cost for suppliers and work-contractors, the use \nof surety bonds as a substitute for bank guarantee will be made acceptable \nin government procurements. Business such as gold imports may also find \nthis useful. IRDAI has given the framework for issue of surety bonds by \ninsurance companies.  \nAVGC Promotion Task Force \n81. The animation, visual effects, gaming, and comic (AVGC) sector \noffers immense potential to employ youth. An AVGC promotion task force \nwith all stakeholders will be set-up to recommend ways to realize this and \nbuild domestic capacity for serving our markets and the global demand.    \nTelecom Sector \n82. Telecommunication in general, and 5G technology in particular, can \nenable growth and offer job opportunities. Required spectrum auctions will \nbe conducted in 2022 to facilitate rollout of 5G mobile services within 2022-\n23 by private telecom providers.  \n83. A scheme for design-led manufacturing will be launched to build a \nstrong ecosystem for 5G as part of the Production Linked Incentive Scheme.  15 \n \n \n \n84. To enable affordable broadband and mobile service proliferation in \nrural and remote areas,  five per cent of annual collections under the \nUniversal Service Obligation Fund will be allocated. This will promote R&D \nand commercialization of technologies and solutions. \n85. Our vision is that all villages and their residents should have the \nsame access to e-services, communication facilities, and digital resources as \nurban areas and their residents. The contracts for laying optical fibre in all \nvillages, including remote areas, will be awarded under the Bharatnet \nproject through PPP in 2022-23. Completion is expected in 2025. Measures \nwill be taken to enable better and more efficient use of the optical fibre.    \nExport Promotion \n86. The Special Economic Zones Act will be replaced with a new \nlegislation that will enable the states to become partners in \u2018Development \nof Enterprise and Service Hubs\u2019. This will cover all large existing and new \nindustrial enclaves to optimally utilise available infrastructure and enhance \ncompetitiveness of exports.      \nAtmaNirbharta in Defence \n87. Our Government is committed to reducing imports and promoting \nAtmaNirbharta in equipment for the Armed Forces. 68 per cent of the \ncapital procurement budget will be earmarked for domestic industry in \n2022-23, up from 58 per cent in 2021-22.  \n88. Defence R&D will be opened up for industry, startups and academia \nwith 25 per cent of defence R&D budget earmarked.  Private industry will \nbe encouraged to take up design and development of military platforms and \nequipment in collaboration with DRDO and other organizations through SPV \nmodel. An independent nodal umbrella body will be set up for meeting \nwide ranging testing and certification requirements.  \nSunrise Opportunities \n89. Artificial Intelligence, Geospatial Systems and Drones, \nSemiconductor and its eco-system, Space Economy, Genomics and \nPharmaceuticals, Green Energy, and Clean Mobility Systems have immense \npotential to assist sustainable development at scale and modernize the \ncountry. They provide employment opportunities for youth, and make \nIndian industry more efficient and competitive.  16 \n \n \n \n90. Supportive policies, light-touch regulations, facilitative actions to \nbuild domestic capacities, and promotion of research & development will \nguide the government\u2019s approach. For R&D in these sunrise opportunities, \nin addition to efforts of collaboration among academia, industry and public \ninstitutions, government contribution will be provided. \nEnergy Transition and Climate Action \n91. The risks of climate change are the strongest negative externalities \nthat affect India and other countries. As Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister said at the \nCOP26 summit in Glasgow last November, \u201cwhat is needed today is mindful \nand deliberate utilisation, instead of mindless and destructive \nconsumption.\u201d The low carbon development strategy as enunciated in the \n\u2018panchamrit\u2019 that he announced is an important reflection of our \ngovernment\u2019s strong commitment towards sustainable development.  \n92. This strategy opens up huge employment opportunities and will take \nthe country on a sustainable development path.  This budget proposes \nseveral near-term and long-term actions accordingly. \nSolar Power \n93. To facilitate domestic manufacturing for the ambitious goal of 280 \nGW of installed solar capacity by 2030, an additional allocation of ` 19,500 \ncrore for Production Linked Incentive for manufacture of high efficiency \nmodules, with priority to fully integrated manufacturing units from \npolysilicon to solar PV modules, will be made. \nCircular Economy \n94. The Circular Economy transition is expected to help in productivity \nenhancement as well as creating large opportunities for new businesses and \njobs. The action plans for ten sectors such as electronic waste, end-of-life \nvehicles, used oil waste, and toxic & hazardous industrial waste are ready. \nThe focus now will be on addressing important cross cutting issues of \ninfrastructure, reverse logistics, technology upgradation and integration \nwith informal sector. This will be supported by active public policies \ncovering regulations, extended producers\u2019 responsibilities framework and \ninnovation facilitation. \nTransition to Carbon Neutral Economy \n95. Five to seven per cent biomass pellets will be co-fired in thermal \npower plants resulting in CO2 savings of 38 MMT annually. This will also 17 \n \n \n \nprovide extra income to farmers and job opportunities to locals and help \navoid stubble burning in agriculture fields. \n96. Saving energy is an important aspect of energy management. Hence, \nenergy efficiency and savings measures will be promoted. This will be done \nin large commercial buildings through the Energy Service Company (ESCO) \nbusiness model. It will facilitate capacity building and awareness for energy \naudits, performance contracts, and common measurement & verification \nprotocol. \n97. Four pilot projects for coal gasification and conversion of coal into \nchemicals required for the industry will be set-up to evolve technical and \nfinancial viability. \n98. The policies and required legislative changes to promote agro \nforestry and private forestry will be brought in. In addition, financial support \nwill be provided to farmers belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled \nTribes, who want to take up agro-forestry.  \nFinancing of Investments \nPublic Capital Investment \n99. Capital investment holds the key to speedy and sustained economic \nrevival and consolidation through its multiplier effect. Capital investment \nalso helps in creating employment opportunities, inducing enhanced \ndemand for manufactured inputs from large industries and MSMEs, services \nfrom professionals, and help farmers through better agri-infrastructure. The \neconomy has shown strong resilience to come out of the effects of the \npandemic with high growth. However, we need to sustain that level to \nmake up for the setback of 2020-21.  \n100. As outlined in para 5 earlier, the virtuous cycle of investment \nrequires public investment to crowd-in private investment.  At this stage, \nprivate investments seem to require that support to rise to their potential \nand to the needs of the economy. Public investment must continue to take \nthe lead and pump-prime the private investment and demand in 2022-23.    \n101. Considering the above imperative, the outlay for capital expenditure \nin the Union Budget is once again being stepped up sharply by 35.4 per cent \nfrom ` 5.54 lakh crore in the current year to ` 7.50 lakh crore in 2022-23. \nThis has increased to more than 2.2 times the expenditure of 2019-20. This \noutlay in 2022-23 will be 2.9 per cent of GDP.    18 \n \n \n \nEffective Capital Expenditure  \n102. With this investment taken together with the provision made for \ncreation of capital assets through Grants-in-Aid to States, the \u2018Effective \nCapital Expenditure\u2019 of the Central Government is estimated at ` 10.68 lakh \ncrore in  2022-23, which will be about 4.1 per cent of GDP.   \nGreen Bonds  \n103. As a part of the government\u2019s overall market borrowings in 2022-23, \nsovereign Green Bonds will be issued for mobilizing resources for green \ninfrastructure. The proceeds will be deployed in public sector projects \nwhich help in reducing the carbon intensity of the economy.   \nGIFT-IFSC \n104. World-class foreign universities and institutions will be allowed in \nthe GIFT City to offer courses in Financial Management, FinTech, Science, \nTechnology, Engineering and Mathematics free from domestic regulations, \nexcept those by IFSCA to facilitate availability of high-end human resources \nfor financial services and technology.  \n105. An International Arbitration Centre will be set up in the GIFT City for \ntimely settlement of disputes under international jurisprudence. \n106. Services for global capital for sustainable & climate finance in the \ncountry will be facilitated in the GIFT City. \nInfrastructure Status \n107. Data Centres and Energy Storage Systems including dense charging \ninfrastructure and grid-scale battery systems will be included in the \nharmonized list of infrastructure. This will facilitate credit availability for \ndigital infrastructure and clean energy storage. \nVenture Capital and Private Equity Investment \n108. Venture Capital and Private Equity invested more than ` 5.5 lakh \ncrore last year facilitating one of the largest start-up and growth ecosystem. \nScaling up this investment requires a holistic examination of regulatory and \nother frictions. An expert committee will be set up to examine and suggest \nappropriate measures. \n \n 19 \n \n \n \nBlended Finance  \n109. Government backed Funds NIIF and SIDBI Fund of Funds have \nprovided scale capital creating a multiplier effect. For encouraging \nimportant sunrise sectors such as Climate Action, Deep-Tech, Digital \nEconomy, Pharma and Agri-Tech, the government will promote thematic \nfunds for blended finance with the government share being limited to 20 \nper cent and the funds being managed by private fund managers.   \nFinancial Viability of Infrastructure Projects \n110. For financing the infrastructure needs, the stepping-up of public \ninvestment will need to be complemented by private capital at a significant \nscale. Measures will be taken to enhance financial viability of projects \nincluding PPP, with technical and knowledge assistance from multi-lateral \nagencies. Enhancing financial viability shall also be obtained by adopting \nglobal best practices, innovative ways of financing, and balanced risk \nallocation. \nDigital Rupee \n111. Introduction of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will give a big \nboost to digital economy. Digital currency will also lead to a more efficient \nand cheaper currency management system. It is, therefore, proposed to \nintroduce Digital Rupee, using blockchain and other technologies, to be \nissued by the Reserve Bank of India starting 2022-23.  \nFinancial Assistance to States for Capital Investment \n112. Reflecting the true spirit of cooperative federalism, the Central \nGovernment is committed to bolstering the hands of the states in \nenhancing their capital investment towards creating productive assets and \ngenerating remunerative employment. The \u2018Scheme for Financial Assistance \nto States for Capital Investment\u2019 has been extremely well received by the \nstates. In deference to the requests received during my meeting with Chief \nMinisters and state Finance Ministers, the outlay for this scheme is being \nenhanced from ` 10,000 crore in the Budget Estimates to ` 15,000 crore in \nthe Revised Estimates for the current year.  \n113. For 2022-23, the allocation is ` 1 lakh crore to assist the states in \ncatalysing overall investments in the economy.  These fifty-year interest \nfree loans are over and above the normal borrowings allowed to the states.  20 \n \n \n \n114. This allocation will be used for PM GatiShakti related and other \nproductive capital investment of the states. It will also include components \nfor:  \n\uf0b7 Supplemental funding for priority segments of PM Gram Sadak \nYojana, including support for the states\u2019 share, \n\uf0b7 Digitisation of the economy, including digital payments and \ncompletion of OFC network, and \n\uf0b7 Reforms related to building byelaws, town planning schemes, \ntransit-oriented development, and transferable development \nrights.  \n115. In 2022-23, in accordance with the recommendations of the 15 th \nFinance Commission, the states will be allowed a fiscal deficit of 4 per cent \nof GSDP of which 0.5 per cent will be tied to power sector reforms, for \nwhich the conditions have already been communicated in 2021-22.    \nFiscal Management \n116. As against a total expenditure of ` 34.83 lakh crore projected in the \nBudget Estimates 2021-22, the Revised Estimate is ` 37.70 lakh crore. The \nRevised Estimate of capital expenditure is ` 6.03 lakh crore. This includes an \namount of ` 51,971 crore towards settlement of outstanding guaranteed \nliabilities of Air India and its other sundry commitments.      \n117. Coming to the Budget Estimates, the total expenditure in 2022-23 is \nestimated at ` 39.45 lakh crore, while the total receipts other than \nborrowings are estimated at ` 22.84 lakh crore. \n118. The revised Fiscal Deficit in the current year is estimated at 6.9 per \ncent of GDP as against 6.8 per cent projected in the Budget Estimates. The \nFiscal Deficit in 2022-23 is estimated at 6.4 per cent of GDP, which is \nconsistent with the broad path of fiscal consolidation announced by me last \nyear to reach a fiscal deficit level below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26. While \nsetting the fiscal deficit level in 2022-23, I am conscious of the need to \nnurture growth, through public investment, to become stronger and \nsustainable.   \nI will, now, move to Part B of my speech. \n \n 21 \n \nPART B \nDirect Tax \n119. Hon'ble Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to thank all the \ntaxpayers of our country who have contributed immensely and \nstrengthened the hands of the government in helping their fellow citizens in \nthis hour of need.   \n \n       \u0926\u093e\u092a\u093f\u092f\u00c2\u0935\u093e\u0915\u0930\u0902\u0927\u00cc\u092f\u00ab\u0930\u093e\u00d5\u016f\u0902\u093f\u0928\u00c2\u092f\u0902\u092f\u0925\u093e\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u0964 \n\u0905\u0936\u0947\u0937\u093e\u00c6\u0915\u00d0\u092a\u092f\u0947\u00fe\u093e\u091c\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0917\u00b1\u0947\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0924\u093f\u00c6\u00fe\u0924\u0903\u0965\u0967\u0967\u0965 \n \nd\u0101payitv\u0101kara\u1e43dharmya\u1e43r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u1e43nitya\u1e43yath\u0101vidhi | \na\u015be\u1e63\u0101nkalpayedr\u0101j\u0101yogak\u1e63em\u0101natandrita\u1e25 || \n \n\u201cThe king must make arrangements for Yogakshema (welfare) \nof the populace by way of abandoning any laxity and by \ngoverning the state in line with Dharma, along with collecting \ntaxes which are in consonance with the Dharma.\u201d \nMahabharat, Shanti ParvaAdhyaya. 72. Shlok 11 \n120. Drawing wisdom from our ancient texts, we continue on the path to \nprogress. The proposals in this budget, while continuing with our declared \npolicy of stable and predictable tax regime, intend to bring more reforms \nthat will take ahead our vision to establish a trustworthy tax regime. This \nwill further simplify the tax system, promote voluntary compliance by \ntaxpayers, and reduce litigation. \nIntroducing new \u2018Updated return\u2019 \n121. India is growing at an accelerated pace and people are undertaking \nmultiple financial transactions. The Income Tax Department has established \na robust framework of reporting of taxpayers' transactions. In this context, \nsome taxpayers may realize that they have committed omissions or \nmistakes in correctly estimating their income for tax payment.  To provide \nan opportunity to correct such errors, I am proposing a new provision 22 \n \npermitting taxpayers to file an Updated Return on payment of additional \ntax. This updated return can be filed within two years from the end of the \nrelevant assessment year. \n \n122.    Presently, if the department finds out that some income has been \nmissed out by the assessee, it goes through a lengthy process of \nadjudication. Instead, with this proposal now, there will be a trust reposed \nin the taxpayers that will enable the assesse e herself to declare the income \nthat she may have missed out earlier while filing her return. Full details of \nthe proposal are given in the Finance Bill. It is an affirmative step in the \ndirection of voluntary tax compliance.   \nReduced Alternate minimum tax rate and Surcharge for Cooperatives \n123. Currently, cooperative societies are required to pay Alternate \nMinimum Tax at the rate of eighteen and one half per cent. However, \ncompanies pay the same at the rate of fifteen per cent. To provide a level \nplaying field between co -operative societies and companies, I, propose to \nreduce this rate for the cooperative societies also to fifteen per cent. \n124. I also propose to reduce the surcharge on co -operative societies \nfrom present 12  per cent  to 7  per cent  for tho se having total income of \nmore than ` 1 crore and up to ` 10 crores.  \n125. This would help in enhancing the income of cooperative societies \nand its members who are mostly from rural and farming communities. \nTax relief to persons with disability \n126.   The parent or guardian of a differently abled person can take an \ninsurance scheme for such person. The present law provides for deduction \nto the parent or guardian only if the lump sum payment or annuity is \navailable to the differently abled person on the death of the subscriber i.e. \nparent or guardian.  \n127. There could be situations where differently abled dependants may \nneed payment of annuity or lump sum amount even during the lifetime of \ntheir parents/guardians. I propose to thus allow the payment of a nnuity and \nlump sum amount to the differently abled dependent during the lifetime of \nparents/guardians, i.e., on parents/ guardians attaining the age of sixty \nyears. \nParity between employees of State and Central government \n128. At present, the Central Gove rnment contributes 14  per cent of the \nsalary of its employee to the National Pension System (NPS) Tier -I. This is \nallowed as a deduction in computing the income of the employee.   23 \n \nHowever, such deduction is allowed only to the extent of 10 per cent of the \nsalary in case of employees of the State government.  To provide equal \ntreatment to both Central and State government employees, I propose to \nincrease the tax deduction limit from 10 per cent to 14 per cent on \nemployer\u2019s contribution to the NPS account of State Government \nemployees as well. This would help in enhancing the social security benefits \nof the state government employees and bring them at par with central \ngovernment employees. \n \nIncentives for Start-ups \n129. Start-ups have emerged as drivers of growth for our economy. Over \nthe past few years, the country has seen a manifold increase in successful \nstart-ups. Eligible start-ups established before 31.3.2022 had been provided \na tax incentive for three consecutive years out of ten years from \nincorporation. In view of the Covid pandemic, I propose to extend the \nperiod of incorporation of the eligible start-up by one more year, that is, up \nto 31.03.2023 for providing such tax incentive. \nIncentives for newly incorporated manufacturing entities under \nconcessional tax regime \n130. In an effort to establish a globally competitive business environment \nfor certain domestic companies, a concessional tax regime of 15 per cent tax \nwas introduced by our government for newly incorporated domestic \nmanufacturing companies. I propose to extend the last date for \ncommencement of manufacturing or production under section 115BAB by \none year i.e. from 31st March, 2023 to 31st March, 2024.  \nScheme for taxation of virtual digital assets \n131. There has been a phenomenal increase in transactions in virtual \ndigital assets.  The magnitude and frequency of these transactions have \nmade it imperative to provide for a specific tax regime.  Accordingly, for the \ntaxation of virtual digital assets, I propose to provide that any income from \ntransfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30 per cent. \n\uf0b7 No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be \nallowed while computing such income except cost of acquisition. \nFurther, loss from transfer of virtual digital asset cannot be set \noff against any other income. \n\uf0b7 Further, in order to capture the transaction details, I also \npropose to provide for TDS on payment made in relation to 24 \n \ntransfer of virtual digital asset at the rate of 1 per cent of such \nconsideration above a monetary threshold. \n\uf0b7 Gift of virtual digital asset is also proposed to be taxed in the \nhands of the recipient. \n \nLitigation management to avoid repetitive appeals by the Department \n132. It has been observed that a lot of time and resources are consumed \nin filing of appeals which involve identical issues. Taking forward our policy \nof sound litigation management, I propose to provide that, if a question of \nlaw in the case of an assessee is identical to a question of law which is \npending in appeal before the jurisdictional High Court or the Supreme Court \nin any case, the filing of further appeal in the case of this assessee by the \ndepartment shall be deferred till such question of law is decided by the \njurisdictional High Court or the Supreme Court. This will greatly help in \nreducing the repeated litigation between taxpayers and the department. \n \nTax incentives to IFSC \n133. Taking forward our efforts to further promote the IFSC, I hereby \npropose to provide that income of a non-resident from offshore derivative \ninstruments, or over the counter derivatives issued by an offshore banking \nunit, income from royalty and interest on account of lease of ship and \nincome received from portfolio management services in IFSC shall be \nexempt from tax, subject to specified conditions.  \n134. Rationalization of Surcharge  \n\uf0b7 In the globalized business world , there are several works contracts \nwhose terms and conditions mandatorily require formation of a \nconsortium. The members in the consortium are generally \ncompanies. In such cases, the income of these AOPs has to suffer a \ngraded surcharge upto 37 per cent, which is a lot more than the \nsurcharge on the individual companies. Accordingly, I propose to cap \nthe Surcharge of these AOP\u2019s at 15 per cent. \n\uf0b7 Further, the long-term capital gains on listed equity shares, units etc. \nare liable to maximum surcharge of 15 per cent, while the other long \nterm capital gains are subjected to a graded surcharge which goes up \nto 37 per cent. I propose to cap the surcharge on long term capital \ngains arising on transfer of any type of assets at 15 per cent. This \nstep will give a boost to the start up community and along with my 25 \n \nproposal on extending tax benefits to manufacturing companies and \nstart ups re affirms our commitment to Atma Nirbhar Bharat. \nClarification in relation to \u2018Health and Education cess\u2019 as business \nexpenditure \n135. The income-tax is not an allowable expenditure for computation of \nbusiness income. This includes tax as well as surcharges. The \u2018Health and \nEducation Cess\u2019 is imposed as an additional surcharge on the taxpayer for \nfunding specific government welfare programs. However, some courts have \nallowed \u2018Health and education \u2018cess\u2019 as business expenditure, which is \nagainst the legislative intent. To reiterate the legislative intent, I propose to \nclarify that any surcharge or cess on income and profits is not allowable as \nbusiness expenditure. \nDeterrence against tax-evasion:  \n136. Presently, there is ambiguity regarding set off, of brought forward \nloss against undisclosed income detected in search operations. It has been \nobserved that in many cases where undisclosed income or suppression of \nsales etc. is detected, payment of tax is avoided by setting off, of losses. In \norder to bring certainty and to increase deterrence among tax evaders, I \npropose to provide that no set off, of any loss shall be allowed against \nundisclosed income detected during search and survey operations. \nRationalizing TDS Provisions   \n137. It has been noticed that as a business promotion strategy, there is a \ntendency on businesses to pass on benefits to their agents. Such benefits \nare taxable in the hands of the agents. In order to track such transactions, I \npropose to provide for tax deduction by the person giving benefits, if the \naggregate value of such benefits exceeds  ` 20,000 during the financial year.   \n138. A few other changes are being made the details of which are there in \nthe Finance Bill.   \n \nIndirect taxes \nRemarkable progress in GST: \n  \n139. GST has been a landmark reform of Independent India showcasing \nt\nhe spirit of Cooperative Federalism. While aspirations were high, there 26 \n \nwere huge challenges too. These challenges were overcome deftly and \npainstakingly under the guidance and oversight of the GST Council.  We can \nnow take pride in a fully IT driven and progressive GST regime that has \nfulfilled the cherished dream of India as one market- one tax. There are still \nsome challenges remaining and we aspire to meet them in the coming year. \nThe right balance between facilitation and enforcement has engendered \nsignificantly better compliance. GST revenues are buoyant despite the \npandemic.   Taxpayers deserve applause for this growth. Not only did they \nadapt to the changes but enthusiastically contributed to the cause by paying \ntaxes.   \nSpecial Economic Zones:  \n140. In Part A of my speech, I have referred to the proposed reforms in \nSEZs. Alongside, we will also undertake reforms in Customs Administration \nof SEZs and it shall henceforth be fully IT driven and function on the \nCustoms National Portal with a focus on higher facilitation and with only \nrisk-based checks. This will ease doing business by SEZ units considerably.  \nThis reform shall be implemented by 30th September 2022. \nCustoms Reforms and duty rate changes  \n141. Customs administration has reinvented itself over the years through \nliberalised procedures and infusion of technology. Faceless Customs has \nbeen fully established. During Covid-19 pandemic, Customs formations have \ndone exceptional frontline work against all odds displaying agility and \npurpose. Customs\u2019 reforms have played a very vital role in domestic capacity \ncreation, providing level playing field to our MSMEs, easing the raw material \nsupply side constraints, enhancing ease of doing business and being an \nenabler to other policy initiatives such as PLIs and Phased Manufacturing \nPlans. My proposals on customs side are aligned to these objectives. \nProject imports and capital goods \n142. National Capital Goods Policy, 2016 aims at doubling the production \nof capital goods by 2025.  This would create employment opportunities and \nresult in increased economic activity. However, several duty exemptions, \neven extending to over three decades in some cases, have been granted to \ncapital goods for various sectors like power, fertilizer, textiles, leather, \nfootwear, food processing and fertilizers. These exemptions have hindered \nthe growth of the domestic capital goods sector.   27 \n \n143. Similarly, project import duty concessions have also deprived the \nlocal producers of a level playing field in areas like coal mining projects, \npower generation, transmission or distribution projects, railway and metro \nprojects. Our experience suggests that reasonable tariffs are conducive to \nthe growth of domestic industry and \u2018Make in India\u2019 without significantly \nimpacting the cost of essential imports.  \n144. Accordingly, it is proposed to phase out the concessional rates in \ncapital goods and project imports gradually and apply a moderate tariff of \n7.5 per cent. Certain exemptions for advanced machineries that are not \nmanufactured within the country shall continue.  \n145. A few exemptions are being introduced on inputs, like specialised \ncastings, ball screw and linear motion guide, to encourage domestic \nmanufacturing of capital goods. \nReview of customs exemptions and tariff simplification \n146. In the last two budgets we have rationalised several customs \nexemptions. We have once again carried out an extensive consultation, \nincluding by crowd sourcing and as a result of these consultations, more \nthan 350 exemption entries are proposed to be gradually phased out. These \ninclude exemption on certain agricultural produce, chemicals, fabrics, \nmedical devices and drugs and medicines for which sufficient domestic \ncapacity exists.  Further, as a simplification measure, several concessional \nrates are being incorporated in the Customs Tariff Schedule itself instead of \nprescribing them through various notifications.   \n147. This comprehensive review will simplify the Customs rate and tariff \nstructure particularly for sectors like chemicals, textiles and metals and \nminimise disputes. Removal of exemption on items which are or can be \nmanufactured in India and providing concessional duties on raw material \nthat go into manufacturing of intermediate products will go many a step \nforward in achieving our objective of \u2018Make in India\u2019 and \u2018Atmanirbhar \nBharat\u2019. \n148. I shall now take up sector specific proposals. \nElectronics \n149. Electronic manufacturing has been growing rapidly. Customs duty \nrates are being calibrated to provide a graded rate structure to facilitate \ndomestic manufacturing of wearable devices, hearable devices and 28 \n \nelectronic smart meters.  Duty concessions are also being given to parts of \ntransformer of mobile phone chargers and camera lens of mobile camera \nmodule and certain other items. This will enable domestic manufacturing of \nhigh growth electronic items. \nGems and Jewellery \n150. To give a boost to the Gems and Jewellery sector, Customs duty on \ncut and polished diamonds and gemstones is being reduced to 5 per cent. \nSimply sawn diamond would attract nil customs duty. To facilitate export of \njewellery through e-commerce, a simplified regulatory framework shall be \nimplemented by June this year. To disincentivise import of undervalued \nimitation jewellery, the customs duty on imitation jewellery is being \nprescribed in a manner that a duty of at least `  400 per Kg is paid on its \nimport. \nChemicals: \n151. Customs duty on certain critical chemicals namely methanol, acetic \nacid and heavy feed stocks for petroleum refining are being reduced, while \nduty is being raised on sodium cyanide for which adequate domestic \ncapacity exists. These changes will help in enhancing domestic value \naddition. \nMSME \n152. Duty on umbrellas is being raised to 20 per cent. Exemption to parts \nof umbrellas is being withdrawn. Exemption is also being rationalised on \nimplements and tools for agri-sector which are manufactured in India. \nCustoms duty exemption given to steel scrap last year is being extended for \nanother year to provide relief to MSME secondary steel producers. Certain \nAnti- dumping and CVD on stainless steel and coated steel flat products, \nbars of alloy steel and high-speed steel are being revoked in larger public \ninterest considering prevailing high prices of metals. \nExports \n153. To incentivise exports, exemptions are being provided on items such \nas embellishment, trimming, fasteners, buttons, zipper, lining material, \nspecified leather, furniture fittings and packaging boxes that may be needed \nby bonafide exporters of handicrafts, textiles and leather garments, leather \nfootwear and other goods.  29 \n \n154. Duty is being reduced on certain inputs required for shrimp \naquaculture so as to promote its exports.  \nTariff measure to encourage blending of fuel \n155. Blending of fuel is a priority of this Government.   To encourage the \nefforts for blending of fuel, unblended fuel shall attract an additional \ndifferential excise duty of ` 2/ litre from the 1st day of October 2022.  \n156. A few other changes are being made in duty rates, Customs Tariff \nand Customs Law the details of which are there in the Finance Bill.   \n157.
