    "content": "2 \n \n \n \n5. Even as a large section of citizens stayed home, milk, vegetable, and \nfruit-suppliers, health and sanitary workers, truck drivers, railways and \npublic transport workers, bank employees, electricity workers, our \nannadatas, police, firemen, and  the armed forces, all had to go about their \nwork as normal, but with the additional anxiety of the virus hanging over \nthem. We recognise this, and I think I speak on behalf of everybody in this \naugust House, when I express my heartfelt gratitude to these men and \nwomen, for how they were able to carry out their work and duty, to provide \nfor the nation\u2019s basics, over those crucial months. \n \n6. Speaker Sir, for public good, Honourable Members of Parliament \nand Members of Legislative Assemblies too offered their s alaries. \n \n7. In May 2020, the government announced the AtmaNirbhar Bharat \npackage (ANB 1.0) . To sustain the recovery, further into the year, we also \nrolled out two more AtmaNirbhar Bharat packages (ANB 2.0 and ANB 3.0). \nTotal financial impact of all AtmaNirbh ar Bharat packages including \nmeasures taken by RBI was estimated to about `27.1 lakh crores which \namounts to more than 13% of GDP.  \n \n8. As a government, we kept a watch on the situation and were \nproactive in our responses. The government, led by the Prime Minister, \nstretched its resources to deliver for most vulnerable sections of our society \n\u2013 the poorest of the poor, the Dalits, Tribals,  the elderly, the migrant \nworkers, and our children. The PMGKY, the three ANB packages, and \nannouncements made later were like five mini-budgets in themselves. \n \n9. The AtmaNirbhar Packages accelerated our pace of structural \nreforms. Redefinition of MSMEs , Commercialisation of the Mineral Sector, \nAgriculture and Labour Reforms, Privatisation of Public Sector Undertakings, \nOne Nation One Ration Card, and Production Linked Incentive Schemes are \nsome of the notable reforms carried out during this period.  Fac eless \nIncome Tax Assessment, DBT and Financial Inclusion are the others.  \n \n10. Today, India has two vaccines available, and has begun medically \nsafeguarding not only her own citizens against COVID -19, but also those of \n100 or more countries. It is added comfor t to know that two or more \nvaccines are also expected soon. \n 3 \n \n \n \n11. Honourable Prime Minister launched the vaccination drive by \ncrediting and thanking our scientists. We are ever grateful for the strength \nand rigour of their efforts. \n \n12. Having said that, we are all  reminded time and again that our fight \nagainst COVID-19 continues into 2021. \n \n13. Now, just as it had happened after the two World Wars, there are \nsigns that the political, economic, and strategic relations in the post COVID \nworld are changing. This moment in  history is the dawn of a new era \u2013 one \nin which India is well -poised to truly be the land of promise and hope.  \n \n''Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark''. \n-Rabindranath Tagore \n(Fireflies \u2013 A Collection of Aphorisms) \n \n14. In this spirit, I can\u2019t help but recall the joy that we, as a cricket-loving \nnation, felt after Team India\u2019s recent spectacular success in Australia. It has \nreminded us of all the qualities that we as a people, particularly our youth, \nepitomise of having  abundant promise and the unsuppressed thirst to \nperform and succeed. \n \n15. Today, data shows that India now has one of the lowest death rate \nof 112 per million population and one of the lowest active cases of  about \n130 per million. This has laid the foundation  to the revival we are seeing \nnow in the economy. \n \n16. This Budget will be the first of this new decade. This Budget will also \nbe a digital Budget and that has happened with all your support. \n \n17. So far, only three times has a Budget followed a contraction in the  \neconomy. All such contractions were as a result of situations typical to \nIndia. This time, the contraction in our economy is due to a global \npandemic, just like in several other countries. \n \n18. Having said that, I want to confidently state that our Government  is \nfully prepared to support and facilitate the economy\u2019s reset. This Budget \nprovides every opportunity for our economy to raise and capture the pace \nthat it needs for sustainable growth. \n \n19. 2021 is the year of many important milestones for our history. I \nmention a few of these: It is the 75 th year of Independence; 60 years of \nGoa\u2019s accession to India; 50 years of the 1971 India -Pakistan War; it will be 4 \n \n \n \nthe year of the 8th Census of Independent India; it will also be India\u2019s turn \nat the BRICS Presidency; the  year for our Chandrayaan -3 Mission; and the \nHaridwar Maha Kumbh. \n \n20. Honourable Speaker, before I commence Part A of the Budget, I \nwant to take a moment to acknowledge how isolating and distancing \nseemed like insurmountable challenges for a country like ours that has \npeople coming together in times of crises. It hurt us in many ways. I bow my \nhead in respect to every citizen, for the endurance shown in facing what \nwas an undeniably a tough year for all our physical and mental well-being.  \n \n \nPART A \n \n21. In Part A, I wish to lay a vision for AtmaNirbhar Bharat. \n \n22. AtmaNirbharta is not a new idea. Ancient India was largely self -\nreliant, and equally, a business epicentre of the world. \n \n23. AtmaNirbhar Bharat is an expression of 130 crores  Indians who have \nfull confidence in their capabilities and skills. \n \n24. We are already part of International groupings such as the G20 and \nBRICS. The Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the \nInternational Solar alliance are realities today due to India\u2019s efforts. \n \n25. The proposals in Part A will further strengthen the sankalp of Nation \nFirst, Doubling Farmer\u2019s Income, Strong Infrastructure, Healthy India, Good \nGovernance, Opportunities for Youth, Education for All, Women \nEmpowerment, and Inclusive Development, among others. \n \n26. Additionally, also on the path to fast -implementation are the 13 \npromises we had made in the Budget of 2015 -16  which were to materialise \nduring the Amrut Mahotsav of 2022, on the 75 th year of our Independence. \nThey too resonate with this vision of AtmaNirbharta. \n \n27. The Budget proposals for 2021-2022 rest on 6 pillars. \ni. Health and Wellbeing \nii. Physical & Financial Capital, and Infrastructure 5 \n \n \n \niii. Inclusive Development for Aspirational India \niv. Reinvigorating Human Capital  \nv. Innovation and R&D \nvi. Minimum Government and Maximum Governance \n \n1. Health and Wellbeing \n \n28. Even at the outset, I would like to say that the investment on Health \nInfrastructure in this Budget has increased substantially. Progressively, as \ninstitutions absorb more, we shall commit more. \n \n29. Taking a holistic approach to Health, we focus on strengthening \nthree areas: Preventive, Curative, and Wellbeing. \n \nHealth Systems \n \n30. A new centrally sponsored scheme, PM AtmaNirbhar Swasth Bharat \nYojana, will be launched with an outlay of  about  ` 64,180 crores over 6 \nyears. This will develop capacities of primary, secondary, and tertiary care \nHealth Systems, strengthen existing national institutions, and create new \ninstitutions, to cater to detection and cure of new and emerging diseases. \nThis will be  in addition to the National Health Mission. The main \ninterventions under the scheme are: \n \na. Support for 17,788 rural and 11,024 urban Health and Wellness \nCenters \nb. Setting up integrated public health labs in all districts and 3382 block \npublic health units in 11 states; \nc. Establishing critical care hospital blocks in 602 districts and 12 \ncentral institutions; \nd. Strengthening of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), its \n5 regional branches and 20 metropolitan health surveillance units; \ne. Expansion of the In tegrated Health Information Portal to all \nStates/UTs to connect all public health labs; \nf. Operationalisation of 17 new Public Health Units and strengthening \nof 33 existing Public Health Units at Points of Entry, that is at 32 \nAirports, 11 Seaports and 7 land crossings; \ng. Setting up of 15 Health Emergency Operation Centers and 2 mobile \nhospitals; and 6 \n \n \n \nh. Setting up of a national institution for One Health, a Regional \nResearch Platform for WHO South East Asia Region, 9 Bio -Safety \nLevel III laboratories and 4 regional  National Institutes for Virology.  \n \nNutrition \n \n31. To strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach, and outcome, \nwe will merge the Supplementary Nutrition Programme and the Poshan \nAbhiyan and launch the Mission Poshan  2.0. We shall adopt an intensified \nstrategy to improve nutritional outcomes across 112 Aspirational Districts.  \n \nUniversal Coverage of Water Supply \n \n32. The World Health Organisation has repeatedly stressed the \nimportance of clean water, sanitation, and clean  environment, as a pre \nrequisite to achieving universal health. \n \n33. The Jal Jeevan Mission (Urban), will be launched.  It aims at universal \nwater supply in all 4,378 Urban Local Bodies with 2.86 crores household tap \nconnections, as well as liquid waste management in 500 AMRUT cities. It \nwill be implemented over 5 years, with an outlay of `2,87,000 crores.  \n \nSwachch Bharat, Swasth Bharat \n \n34. For further swachhta of urban India, we intend to focus on complete \nfaecal sludge management and waste water treatment, source segregation \nof garbage, reduction in single -use plastic, reduction in air pollution by \neffectively managing waste from construction -and-demolition activities and \nbio-remediation of all legacy dump  sites. The Urban Swachh Bharat Mission  \n2.0 will be implemented with a total financial allocation of `1,41,678 crores \nover a period of 5 years from 2021-2026. \n \nClean Air \n \n35. To tackle the burgeoning problem of  air pollution, I propose to \nprovide an amount of `2,217 crores for 42 urban centres with a million-plus \npopulation in this budget.  \n 7 \n \n \n \nScrapping Policy \n \n36. We are separately announcing a voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, \nto phase out old and unfit vehicles. This will help in encouraging fuel -\nefficient, environment friendly vehicles, thereby reducing vehicular \npollution and oil import bill.  Vehicles would u ndergo fitness tests in \nautomated fitness centres after 20 years in case of personal vehicles, and \nafter 15 years in case of commercial vehicles. Details of the scheme will be \nseparately shared by the Ministry.  \n \nVaccines \n \n37. The Pneumococcal Vaccine, a Made in India product, is presently \nlimited to only 5 states will be rolled out across the country. This will avert \nmore than 50,000 child deaths annually. \n \n38. I have provided `35,000 crores for Covid-19 vaccine in BE 2021 -22. I \nam committed to provide further funds if required. \n \n39. The Budget outlay for Health and Wellbeing is `2,23,846 crores in BE \n2021-22 as against this year\u2019s BE of `94,452 crores an increase of  137 \npercentage. The details of the same are at Annexure I of the Speech.  \n \n2. Physical and Financial Capital and Infrastructure \n \nAtmaNirbhar Bharat \u2013 Production Linked Incentive scheme (PLI) \n \n40. For a USD 5 trillion economy, our manufacturing sector has to grow \nin double digits on a sustained basis. Our manufacturing companies need to \nbecome an integral par t of global supply chains, possess core competence \nand cutting -edge technology. To achieve all of the above, PLI schemes to \ncreate manufacturing global champions for an AtmaNirbhar Bharat have \nbeen announced for 13 sectors.  For this, the government has co mmitted \nnearly `1.97 lakh crores, over 5 years starting FY 2021-22. This initiative will \nhelp bring scale and size in key sectors, create and nurture global \nchampions and provide jobs to our youth.   \n \n 8 \n \n \n \nTextiles \n \n41. To enable the textile industry to become globally competitive, \nattract large investments and boost employment generation, a scheme of \nMega Investment Textiles Parks (MITRA)  will be launched in addition to the \nPLI scheme. This will create world class infras tructure with plug and play \nfacilities to enable create global champions in exports. 7 Textile Parks will \nbe established over 3 years.  \n \nInfrastructure \n \n42. The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) which I announced in \nDecember 2019 is the first -of-its-kind, whole -of-government exercise ever \nundertaken by Government of India. The NIP was launched with 6835 \nprojects; the project pipeline has now expanded to 7 ,400 projects. Around \n217 projects worth `1.10 lakh crores under some key infrastructure \nMinistries have been completed.  \n \n43. The NIP is a specific target which this government is committed to \nachieving over the coming years. It will require a major increase in funding \nboth from the government and the financial sector. In this Budget, I \npropose to take concrete steps to do this, in three ways:  \n \n44. Firstly, by creating the institutional structures; secondly, by a big \nthrust on monetizing assets, and thirdly by enhancing the share of capital \nexpenditure in central and state budgets. \n \n \nInfrastructure financing - Development Financial Institution (DFI)  \n \n45. Infrastructure needs long term debt financing. A professionally \nmanaged Development Financial Institution is necessary to act as a \nprovider, enabler and catalyst for infrastructure financing. Accordingly, I \nshall introduce a Bill to set up a DFI. I have provided a sum of `20,000 crores \nto capitalise this institution. The ambition is to have a lending portfolio of at \nleast `5 lakh crores for this DFI in three years time. \n 9 \n \n \n \n46. Debt Financing of InVITs and REITs by Foreign Portfolio Investors will \nbe enabled by making suitable amendments in the relevant legislations. This \nwill further ease access of finance to InVITS and REITs thus augmenting \nfunds for infrastructure and real estate sectors. \n \nAsset Monetisation \n \n47. Monetizing operating public infrastructure assets is a very important \nfinancing option for new infrastructure construction. A \u201cNational \nMonetization Pipeline\u201d of potential brownfield infrastructure assets will be \nlaunched.  An Asset Monetization dashboard will also be created for \ntracking the progress and to provide visibility to investors. Some important \nmeasures in the direction of monetisation are: \n \na. National Highways Authority of India and PGCIL each have \nsponsored one InvIT  that will attract international and domestic \ninstitutional investors. Five operational roads with an estimated \nenterprise value of ` 5,000 crores are being transferred to the NHAI \nInvIT.  Similarily, transmission assets of a value of `7,000 crores will \nbe transferred to the PGCIL InvIT. \nb. Railways will monetise Dedicated Freight Corridor assets for \noperations and maintenance, after commissioning.  \nc. The next lot of Airports will be monetised for operations and \nmanagement concession.  \nd. Other core infrastructure assets that will be rolled out under the \nAsset Monetization Programme are: (i) NHAI Operational Toll Roads \n(ii) Transmission Assets of PGCIL (iii) Oil and Gas Pipelines of GAIL, \nIOCL and HPCL (iv) AAI Airports in Tier II and III c ities, (v) Other \nRailway Infrastructure Assets (vi) Warehousing Assets of CPSEs such \nas Central Warehousing Corporation and NAFED among others and \n(vii) Sports Stadiums. \n  \nSharp Increase in Capital Budget \n \n48. In the BE 2020 -21, we had provided `4.12 lakh cror es for Capital \nExpenditure. It was our effort that in spite of resource crunch we should \nspend more on capital and we are likely to end the year at around `4.39 10 \n \n \n \nlakh crores which I have provided in the RE 2020-21.  For 2021-22, I propose \na sharp increase i n capital expenditure and thus have provided `5.54 lakh \ncrores which is 34.5% more than the BE of 2020 -21.  Of this, I have kept a \nsum of more than `44,000 crores in the Budget head of the Department of \nEconomic Affairs to be provided for projects/programm es/departments \nthat show good progress on Capital Expenditure and are in need of further \nfunds. Over and above this expenditure, we would also be providing more \nthan `2 lakh crores to States and Autonomous Bodies for their Capital \nExpenditure.   \n \n49. We will also work out specific mechanisms to nudge States to spend \nmore of their budget on creation of infrastructure. \n \nRoads and Highways Infrastructure \n \n50. More than 13,000 km length of roads, at a cost of `3.3 lakh crores, \nhas already been awarded under the `5.35 lakh crores Bharatmala \nPariyojana project of which 3,800 kms have been constructed. By March \n2022, we would be awarding another 8,500 kms and complete an additional \n11,000 kms of national highway corridors. \n \n51. To further augment road infrastructure, mor e economic corridors \nare also being planned. Some are:  \n \na. 3,500 km of National Highway works in the state of Tamil Nadu at an \ninvestment of `1.03 lakh crores. These include Madurai -Kollam \ncorridor, Chittoor -Thatchur corridor. Construction will start next \nyear. \nb. 1,100 km of National Highway works in the State of Kerala at an \ninvestment of `65,000 crores including 600 km section of Mumbai -\nKanyakumari corridor in Kerala. \nc. 675 km of highway works in the state of West Bengal at a cost of \n`25,000 crores including upgradation of existing road -Kolkata \u2013 \nSiliguri. \nd. National Highway works of around `19,000 crores are currently in \nprogress in the State of Assam. Further works of more than `34,000 11 \n \n \n \ncrores covering more than 1300 kms of National Highways will be \nundertaken in the State in the coming three years.  \n \n52. Some of the flagship corridors and other important projects that \nwould see considerable activity in 2021-22 are in Annexure-II.   \n \n53. I am also providing an enhanced outlay of `1,18,101 lakh crores for \nMinistry of Roa d Transport and Highways, of which `1,08,230 crores is for \ncapital, the highest ever. \n \nRailway Infrastructure \n \n54. Indian Railways have prepared a National Rail Plan for India \u2013 2030. \nThe Plan is to create a \u2018future ready\u2019 Railway system by 2030. \n \n55. Bringing down the logistic costs for our industry is at the core of our \nstrategy to enable \u2018Make in India\u2019. It is expected that Western Dedicated \nFreight Corridor (DFC) and Eastern DFC will be commissioned by June 2022. \nThe following additional initiatives are proposed: \n \na. The Sonnagar \u2013 Gomoh Section (263.7 km) of Eastern DFC will be \ntaken up in PPP mode in 2021 -22. Gomoh-Dankuni section of 274.3 \nkm will also be taken up in short succession. \nb.  We will undertake future dedicated freight corridor projects namely \nEast Co ast corridor from Kharagpur to Vijayawada, East -West \nCorridor from Bhusaval to Kharagpur to Dankuni and North -South \ncorridor from Itarsi to Vijayawada. Detailed Project Reports will be \nundertaken in the first phase.    \nc. Broad Gauge Route Kilometers (RKM) electrified is expected to reach \n46,000 RKM i.e., 72% by end of 2021 from 41,548 RKM on 1 st Oct \n2020. 100% electrification of Broad -Gauge routes will be completed \nby December, 2023.  \n \n56. For Passenger convenience and safety the following measures are \nproposed: 12 \n \n \n \na. We will introduce the aesthetically designed Vista Dome LHB coach \non tourist routes to give a better travel experience to passengers.   \nb. The safety measures undertaken in the past few years have borne \nresults. To further strengthen this effort, high density  network and \nhighly utilized network routes of Indian railways will be provided \nwith an indigenously developed automatic train protection system  \nthat eliminates train collision due to human error.  \nc. I am providing a record sum of `1,10,055 crores, for Railways of \nwhich `1,07,100 crores is for capital expenditure.  \n \nUrban Infrastructure \n57. We will work towards raising the share of public transport in urban \nareas through expansion of metro rail network and augmentation of city bus \nservice. A new scheme will be launched at a cost of `18,000 crores  to \nsupport augmentation of public bus transport services. The scheme will \nfacilitate deployment of innovative PPP models to enable private sector \nplayers to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses.  The \nscheme will boost the automobile se ctor, provide fillip to economic growth, \ncreate employment opportunities for our youth and enhance ease of \nmobility for urban residents.  \n \n58. A total of 702 km of conventional metro is operational and another \n1,016 km of metro and RRTS is under construction i n 27 cities. Two new \ntechnologies i.e., \u2018MetroLite\u2019 and \u2018MetroNeo\u2019 will be deployed to provide \nmetro rail systems at much lesser cost with same experience, convenience \nand safety in Tier-2 cities and peripheral areas of Tier-1 cities.   \n \n59. Central counterpart funding will be provided to: \na. Kochi Metro Railway Phase-II of 11.5 km at a cost of `1957.05 crores. \nb. Chennai Metro Railway Phase -II of 118.9 km at a cost of `63,246 \ncrores.  \nc. Bengaluru Metro Railway Project Phase 2A and 2B of 58.19 km at a \ncost of `14,788 crores. \nd. Nagpur Metro Rail Project Phase -II and Nashik Metro at a cost of \n`5,976 crores and `2,092 crores respectively. \n 13 \n \n \n \nPower Infrastructure \n \n60. The past 6 years have seen a number of reforms and achievements \nin the power sector.  We have added 139 Giga Watts of installed capacity, \nconnected an additional 2.8 crores households and added 1.41 lakh circuit \nkm of transmission lines.  \n \n61. The distribution  companies across the country are monopolies ,  \neither government or private. There is a need to provide choice to \nconsumers by promoting competition. A framework will be put in place to \ngive consumers alternatives to choose from among more than one \nDistribution Company. \n \n62. The viability of Distribution Companies is a serious concern. A \nrevamped reforms -based result -linked power distribution sector scheme \nwill be launched with an outlay of `3,05,984 crores  over 5 years. The \nscheme will provide assistance to DISCOMS for Infrastructure creation \nincluding pre -paid smart metering and feeder separation, upgradation of \nsystems, etc., tied to financial improvements. \n \n63. Prime Minister, while speaking at the 3 rd Re-inVest Conference in \nNovember 2020, had announced plans  to launch a comprehensive National \nHydrogen Energy Mission. It is now proposed to launch a  Hydrogen Energy \nMission in  2021-22 for generating hydrogen from green power sources.   \n  \nPorts, Shipping, Waterways \n \n64. Major Ports will be moving from managing their operational services \non their own to a model where a private partner will manage it for them.  \nFor the purpose, 7 projects worth more than `2,000 crores will be offered \nby the Major Ports on Public Private Partnership mode in FY21-22.  \n \n65. A scheme to promote  flagging of merchant ships in India  will be \nlaunched by providing subsidy support to Indian shipping companies in \nglobal tenders floated by Ministries and CPSEs. An amount of `1624 crores \nwill be provided over 5 years. This initiative will enable greater training and 14 \n \n \n \nemployment opportunities for Indian seafarers besides enhancing Indian \ncompanies share in global shipping. \n \n66. India has enacted Recycling of Ships Act, 2019 and acceded to the \nHong Kong International Convention.  Around 90 ship recycling yards at \nAlang in Gujarat have already achieved HKC -compliant certificates. Efforts \nwill be made to bring more ships to India fr om Europe and Japan. Recycling \ncapacity of around 4.5 Million Light Displacement Tonne (LDT) will be \ndoubled by 2024. This is expected to generate an additional 1.5 lakh jobs for \nour youth.  \n \nPetroleum & Natural Gas \n \n67. Our government has kept fuel supplies r unning across the country \nwithout interruption during the COVID -19 lockdown period. Taking note of \nthe crucial nature of this sector in people\u2019s lives, the following key initiatives \nare being announced: \n \na. Ujjwala Scheme which has benefited 8 crores households will be \nextended to cover 1 crores more beneficiaries. \nb. We will add 100 more districts in next 3 years to the City Gas \nDistribution network.   \nc. A gas pipeline project will be taken up in Union Territory of Jammu & \nKashmir.  \nd. An independent Gas Transport System Operator will be set up for \nfacilitation and coordination of booking of common carrier capacity \nin all -natural gas pipelines on a non -discriminatory open access \nbasis.  \n \nFinancial Capital \n68. I propose to consolidate the pro visions of SEBI Act, 1992, \nDepositories Act, 1996, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and \nGovernment Securities Act, 2007 into a rationalized single Securities \nMarkets Code.   \n   \n 15 \n \n \n \n69. The Government would support the development of a world class \nFin-Tech hub at the GIFT-IFSC. \n \n70. To instill confidence amongst the participants in the Corporate Bond \nMarket during times of stress and to generally enhance secondary market \nliquidity, it is proposed to create a permanent institutional framework.  The \nproposed body would purchase investment grade debt securities both in \nstressed and normal times and help in the development of the Bond \nmarket.   \n \n71. In the budget of 2018 -19, Government had announced its intent to \nestablish a system of regulated gold exchanges in  the country. For the \npurpose, SEBI will be notified as the regulator and Warehousing \nDevelopment and Regulatory Authority will be strengthened to set up a \ncommodity market eco system arrangement including vaulting, assaying, \nlogistics etc in addition to warehousing.  \n \n72. Towards investor protection, I propose to introduce an investor \ncharter as a right of all financial investors across all financial products.  \n \n73. To give a further boost to the non -conventional energy sector, I \npropose to provide additional capi tal infusion of `1,000 crores to Solar \nEnergy Corporation of India and `1,500 crores to Indian Renewable Energy \nDevelopment Agency.   \n \nIncreasing FDI in Insurance Sector \n \n74. I propose to amend the Insurance Act, 1938 to increase the \npermissible FDI  limit from 49% to 74% in Insurance Companies and allow \nforeign ownership and control with safeguards . Under the new structure, \nthe majority of Directors on the Board and key management persons would \nbe resident Indians, with at least 50% of Directors being Independent \nDirectors, and specified percentage of profits being retained as general \nreserve.  \n \nStressed Asset Resolution by setting up a New Structure \n \n75. The high level of provisioning by public sector banks of their stressed \nassets calls for measures to clean up the bank books.  An Asset 16 \n \n \n \nReconstruction Company Limited and Asset Management Company would \nbe set up to consolidate and take over the existing  stressed debt and then \nmanage and dispose of the assets to Alternate Investment Funds and other \npotential investors for eventual value realization. \n \nRecapitalization of PSBs \n \n76. To further consolidate the financial capacity of PSBs , further \nrecapitalization of `20,000 crores is proposed in 2021-22. \n \nDeposit Insurance \n \n77. Last year, Government had approved an increase in the Deposit \nInsurance cover from `1 lakh to `5 lakhs for bank customers. I shall be \nmoving amendments to the DICGC Act, 1961 in this Session itself to \nstreamline the provisions, so that if a bank is temporarily unable to fulfil its \nobligations, the depositors of such a bank can get easy and time -bound \naccess to their deposits to the extent of the deposit insurance cover. This \nwould help depositors of banks that are currently under stress.  \n \n78. To improve credit discipline while continuing to protect the interest \nof small borrowers, for NBFCs with minimum asset size of `100 crores, the \nminimum loan size eligible for debt recovery under the Securitisation and \nReconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest \n(SARFAESI) Act, 2002 is proposed to be reduced from the existing level of \n`50 lakhs to `20 lakhs. \n \nCompany Matters \n \n79. The decriminalizing of the procedural and technical compoundable \noffences under the Companies Act, 2013, is now complete. I now propose \nto next take up decriminalization of the Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) \nAct, 2008. \n \n80. Sir, I propose to revise the definition under the Companies Act, 2013 \nfor Small Companies by increasing their thresholds for Paid up capital from \n\u201cnot exceeding `50 Lakh\u201d to \u201cnot exceeding `2 Crore\u201d and turnover from \n\u201cnot exceeding `2 Crore \u201d to \u201cnot exceeding `20 C rore\u201d. This will benefit 17 \n \n \n \nmore than two lakh companies in easing their compliance requirements.  \n \n81. As a further measure which directly benefits Start -ups and \nInnovators, I propose to incentivize the incorporation of One Person \nCompanies ( OPCs) by allowing OPCs to grow without any restrictions on \npaid up capital and turnover, allowing their conversion into any other type \nof company at any time, reducing the residency limit for an Indian citizen to \nset up an OPC from 182 days to 120 days and  also allow Non Resident \nIndians (NRIs) to incorporate OPCs in India.  \n \n82. To ensure faster resolution of cases, NCLT framework will be \nstrengthened, e -Courts system shall be implemented and alternate \nmethods of debt resolution and special framework for MSMEs  shall be \nintroduced.  \n \n83. During the coming fiscal 2021 -22, we will be launching  data \nanalytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning driven MCA21 Version 3.0. \nThis Version 3.0 will have additional modules for e -scrutiny, e-Adjudication, \ne-Consultation and Compliance Management. \n \nDisinvestment and Strategic Sale \n \n84. In spite of COVID- 19, we have kept working towards strategic \ndisinvestment. A number of transactions namely BPCL, Air India, Shipping \nCorporation of India, Container Corporation of India, IDBI  Bank, BEML, \nPawan Hans, Neelachal Ispat Nigam limited among others would be \ncompleted in 2021 -22. Other than IDBI Bank, we propose to take up the \nprivatization of two Public Sector Banks and one General Insurance \ncompany in the year 2021 -22.  This would r equire legislative amendments \nand I propose to introduce the amendments in this Session itself.  \n \n85. In 2021 -22 we would also bring the IPO of LIC for which I am \nbringing the requisite amendments in this Session itself.   \n \n86. In the AtmaNirbhar Package, I had ann ounced that we will come out \nwith a policy of strategic disinvestment of public sector enterprises.  I am \nhappy to inform the House that the Government has approved the said \npolicy.  The policy provides a clear roadmap for disinvestment in all non-\nstrategic and strategic sectors.  We have kept four areas that are strategic 18 \n \n \n \nwhere bare minimum CPSEs will be maintained and rest privatized. In the \nremaining sectors all CPSEs will be privatized. The main highlights of the \npolicy are mentioned at Annexure-III. \n \n87. To fast forward the disinvestment policy, I am asking NITI to work \nout on the next list of Central Public Sector companies that would be taken \nup for strategic disinvestment. \n \n88. To similarly incentivise States to take to disinvestment of their Public \nSector Companies, we will work out an incentive package of Central Funds \nfor States. \n \n89. Idle assets will not contribute to AtmaNirbhar Bharat. The non -core \nassets largely consist of surplus land with government \nMinistries/Departments and Public Sector Enterprises. Monetizing of land \ncan either be by way of direct sale or concession or by similar means. This \nrequires special abilities and for this purpose, I propose to use a Special \nPurpose Vehicle in the form of a company that would carry out this activity.  \n \n90. In orde r to ensure timely completion of closure of sick or loss \nmaking CPSEs, we will introduce a revised mechanism that will ensure \ntimely closure of such units. \n \n91. I have estimated ` 1,75,000 crores as receipts from disinvestment  in \nBE 2021-22. \n \nGovernment Financial Reforms \n \n92. Under the Treasury Single Account (TSA) System autonomous bodies \ndirectly draw funds from the Government\u2019s account at the time of actual \nexpenditure, saving interest costs. We will extend the TSA System for \nuniversal application from 2021-22. \n \n93. On the recommendation of the Fifteenth Finance Commission, we \nhave undertaken a detailed exercise to rationalise and bring down the \nnumber of Centrally Sponsored Schemes. This will enable consolidation of \noutlays for better impact. \n 19 \n \n \n \n94. The Government i s committed to the development of Multi- State \nCooperatives and will provide all support to them. To further streamline the \n\u2018Ease of Doing Business\u2019 for Cooperatives, I propose to set up a separate \nAdministrative Structure for them. \n \n3. Inclusive Development for Aspirational India \n \n95. Honourable Speaker Sir, under this pillar, I will cover Agriculture and \nAllied sectors, farmers\u2019 welfare and rural India, migrant workers and labour, \nand financial inclusion. \n \nAgriculture \n \n96. Our Government is committed to the welfare of farmers.  The MSP \nregime has undergone a sea change to assure price that is at least 1.5 times \nthe cost of production across all commodities. The procurement has also \ncontinued to increase at a steady pace.  This has resulted in increase in \npayment to farmers substantially. \n \n97. In case of wheat, the total amount paid to farmers in 2013 -2014 was \n`33,874 crores. In 2019 -2020 it was `62,802 crores, and even better, in \n2020-2021, this amount, paid to farmers, was `75,060 crores.  The number \nof wheat  growing farmers that were benefitted increased in 2020 -21 to \n43.36 lakhs as compared to 35.57 lakhs in 2019-20. \n \n98. For paddy, the amount paid in 2013 -14 was `63,928 crores. In 2019-\n2020 this increased `1,41,930 crores . Even better, in 2020 -2021, this is \nfurther estimated to increase to `172,752 crores.  The number of farmers \nbenefitted increased from 1.24 crores in 2019 -20 to 1.54 crores in 2020 -21.   \n \n99. In the same vein, in case of pulses, the amount paid in 2013 -2014 \nwas `236 crores. In 2019-20 it increased `8,285 crores. Now, in 2020 -2021, \nit is at `10,530 crores, a more than 40 times increase from 2013 -14.  \n \n100. The receipts to cotton farmers have seen a stupendous increase \nfrom `90 crores in 2013 -14 to `25,974 crores  (as on 27 th January 2021).  \nThe details are in Annexure IV.  \n 20 \n \n \n \n101. Early this year, Honourable Prime Minister had launched SWAMITVA \nScheme. Under this, a record of rights is being given to property owners in \nvillages. Up till now, about 1.80 lakh property -owners in 1,241 villages have \nbeen provided cards. I now propose during FY21 -22 to extend this to cover \nall states/UTs. \n \n102. To provide adequate credit to our farmers, I have enhanced the \nagricultural credit target to `16.5 lakh crores in FY22. We will focus on \nensuring increased credit flows to animal husbandry, dairy, and fisheries.  \n \n103. We are enhancing the allocation to the Rural Infrastructure \nDevelopment Fund from `30,000 crores to `40,000 crores. \n \n104. The Micro Irrigation Fund, with a corpus of `5,000 crores has be en \ncreated under NABARD, I propose to double it by augmenting it by another \n`5,000 crores. \n \n105. To boost value addition in agriculture and allied products and their \nexports, the scope of \u2018Operation Green Scheme\u2019 that is presently applicable \nto tomatoes, onions, and potatoes, will be enlarged to include 22 perishable \nproducts.  \n \n106. Around 1.68 crores farmers are registered and ` 1.14 lakh crores of \ntrade value has been carried out through e -NAMs. Keeping in view the \ntransparency and competitiveness that e -NAM has brought into the \nagricultural market, 1,000 more mandis will be integrated with e -NAM. \n  \n107. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund  would be made available to \nAPMCs for augmenting their infrastructure facilities. \n \nFisheries \n \n108. I am proposing substantial investments in the development of \nmodern fishing harbours and fish landing centres. To start with, 5 maj or \nfishing harbours \u2013 Kochi, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Paradip, and Petuaghat \u2013 \nwill be developed as hubs of economic activity. We will also develop inland \nfishing harbours and fish -landing centres along the banks of rivers and \nwaterways.  \n 21 \n \n \n \n109. Seaweed farming i s an emerging sector with potential to transform \nthe lives of coastal communities.  It will provide large scale employment and \nadditional incomes. To promote seaweed cultivation, I propose a \nMultipurpose Seaweed Park to be established in Tamil Nadu.  \n \nMigrant Workers and Labourers \n \n110. We have launched the One Nation One Ration Card scheme through \nwhich beneficiaries can claim their rations anywhere in the country . \nMigrant workers in particular benefit from this scheme \u2013 those staying away \nfrom their families can partially claim their ration where they are stationed, \nwhile their family, in their native places, can claim the rest. I  am happy to \ninform you that One Nation One Ration Card plan is under implementation \nby 32 states and UTs, reaching about 69 crores beneficiaries \u2013 that\u2019s a total \nof 86% beneficiaries covered. The remaining 4 states and UTs will be \nintegrated in the next few months. \n \n111. To further extend our efforts toward s the unorganised labour force  \nmigrant workers particularly,  I propose to launch a portal that will collect \nrelevant information on gig, building, and construction -workers among \nothers. This will help formulate Health, Housing, Skill, Insurance, Credit, and \nfood schemes for migrant workers. \n \n112. We will conclude a proc ess that began 20 years ago, with the \nimplementation of the 4 labour codes. For the first time globally, social \nsecurity benefits will extend to gig and platform workers. Minimum wages \nwill apply to all categories of workers, and they will all be covered b y the \nEmployees State Insurance Corporation. Women will be allowed to work in \nall categories and also in the night -shifts with adequate protection. At the \nsame time, compliance burden on employers will be reduced with single \nregistration and licensing, and online returns. \n \nFinancial Inclusion \n \n113. To further facilitate credit flow under the scheme of Stand Up India \nfor SCs, STs, and women, I propose to reduce the margin money \nrequirement from 25% to 15%, and to also include loans for activities allied \nto agriculture. 22 \n \n \n \n \n114. We have taken a number of steps to support the MSME sector. In \nthis Budget, I have provided `15,700 crores to this sector, more than double \nof this year\u2019s BE.  \n \n4. Reinvigorating Human Capital \n \n115. The National Education Policy (NEP) announced recently  has had \ngood reception. \n \nSchool Education \n \n116. More than 15,000 schools will be qualitatively strengthened to \ninclude all components of the National Education Policy. They shall emerge \nas exemplar schools in their regions, handholding and mentoring other \nschools to achieve the ideals of the Policy. \n \n117. 100 new Sainik Schools will be set up in partnership with NGOs/  \nprivate schools/states. \n \nHigher Education \n \n118. In Budget 2019 -20, I had mentioned about the setting -up of Higher \nEducation Commission of India. We would be introducing Legislation this \nyear to implement the same. It will be an umbrella body having 4 separate \nvehicles for standard -setting, accreditation , regulation, and funding.  \n \n119. Many of our cities have various research institutions, universities, \nand colleges supported by the Government of India. Hyderabad for \nexample, has about 40 such major institutions. In 9 such cities, we will \ncreate formal umbrella structures so that these institutions can have better \nsynergy, while also retaining their internal autonomy. A Glue Grant will be \nset aside for this purpose. \n \n120. For accessible higher education in Ladakh, I propose to set up a \nCentral University in Leh.  \n \n121. The other important projects to be taken up as part of NEP are listed \nat Annexure V. 23 \n \n \n \n \nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Welfare \n \n122. We have set ourselves a target of establishing 750 Eklavya model \nresidential schools in our tribal areas. I propose to incr ease the unit cost of \neach such school from `20 crores to `38 crores, and for hilly and difficult \nareas, to `48 crores. This would help in creating robust infrastructure \nfacilities for our tribal students. \n \n123. We have revamped the Post Matric Scholarship Scheme, for the \nwelfare of Scheduled Castes. I have also enhanced the Central Assistance in \nthis regard. We are allotting ` 35,219 crores for 6 years till 2025 -2026, to \nbenefit 4 crores SC students. \n \nSkilling \n \n124. In 2016, we had launched the National Apprenti ceship Promotion \nScheme. The Government proposes to amend the Apprenticeship Act with a \nview to further enhancing apprenticeship opportunities for our youth. We \nwill realign the existing scheme of National Apprenticeship Training Scheme \n(NATS) for providin g post -education apprenticeship, training of graduates \nand diploma holders in Engineering. Over `3,000 crores will be provided for \nthis.  \n \n125. An initiative is underway, in partnership with the United Arab \nEmirates (UAE), to benchmark skill qualifications, ass essment, and \ncertification, accompanied by the deployment of certified workforce. We \nalso have a collaborative Training Inter Training Programme (TITP) between \nIndia and Japan to facilitate transfer of Japanese industrial and vocational \nskills, technique, and knowledge.  We will take forward this initiative with \nmany more countries. \n \n5. Innovation and R&D \n \n126. In my Budget Speech of July 2019, I had announced the National \nResearch Foundation. We have now worked out the modalities  and the NRF \noutlay will be of `50,000 crores, over 5 years. It will ensure that the overall 24 \n \n \n \nresearch ecosystem of the country is strengthened with focus on identified \nnational-priority thrust areas. \n \n127. There has been a manifold increase in digital payments in the recent \npast. To give a fu rther boost to digital transactions, I earmark `1,500 crores \nfor a proposed scheme that will provide financial incentive to promote \ndigital modes of payment. \n \n128. We will undertake a new initiative \u2013 National Language Translation \nMission (NTLM). This will enab le the wealth of governance -and-policy \nrelated knowledge on the Internet being made available in major Indian \nlanguages.  \n \n129. The New Space India Limited (NSIL), a PSU under the Department of \nSpace will execute the PSLV -CS51 launch, carrying the Amazonia Sate llite \nfrom Brazil, along with a few smaller Indian satellites. \n \n130. As part of the Gaganyaan mission activities, four Indian astronauts \nare being trained on Generic Space Flight aspects, in Russia. The first \nunmanned launch is slated for December 2021. \n \n131. Our oceans are a storehouse of living and non -living resources. To \nbetter understand this realm, we will launch a Deep Ocean Mission with a \nbudget outlay of more than `4,000 crores, over five years. This Mission will \ncover deep ocean survey exploration and proje cts for the conservation of \ndeep sea bio-diversity.  \n \n6.  Minimum Government, Maximum Governance \n132. Speaker Sir, I now come to the last of the six pillars. This will outline \nplans for reforms in one of our core principles of minimum gover nment, \nmaximum governance. \n \n133. We have taken a number of steps to bring reforms in Tribunals in \nthe last few years for speedy delivery of justice. Continuing with the \nreforms process, I now  propose to take further measures to rationalize the \nfunctioning of Tribunals. \n \n134. We have introduced the National Commission for Allied Healthcare \nProfessionals Bill in Parliament, with a view to ensure transparent and 25 \n \n \n \nefficient regulation of the 56 allied healthcare professions. Additionally, to \nbring about transparency, efficiency and  governance reforms in the nursing \nprofession, The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission Bill will be \nintroduced by the government for passing. \n \n135. To have ease of doing business for those who deal with Government \nor CPSEs, and carry out contracts, I prop ose to set up a Conciliation \nMechanism and mandate its use for quick resolution of contractual \ndisputes. This will instil confidence in private investors and contractors.  \n \n136. The forthcoming Census could be the first digital census in the \nhistory of India. Fo r this monumental and milestone -marking task, I have \nallocated `3,768 crores in the year 2021-2022. \n \n137. Goa is celebrating the diamond jubilee year of the state\u2019s liberation \nfrom Portuguese rule. From the GoI\u2019s side, I propose a grant of `300 crores \nto the Government of Goa for the celebrations. \n \n138. I propose to provide `1,000 crores for the welfare of Tea workers \nespecially women and their children in Assam and West Bengal. A special \nscheme will be devised for the same. \n \n \nFiscal Position \n \n139. In these last few paragraphs of Part A of my speech, I draw the \nattention of this august House to the fact that, at the beginning of the \ncurrent Financial Year, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy resulted in a \nweak revenue inflow. This was combined with high expenditure t o provide \nessential relief to vulnerable sections of the society especially the poor, \nwomen, SCs and STs. \n \n140.  Unlike many other countries, we opted for a series of medium -sized \npackages during the pandemic so that we could calibrate and target our \nresponse a ccording to an evolving situation. Once the health situation \nstabilised, and the lockdown was being slowly lifted, we switched to \nramping up Government spending so as to revive domestic demand. As a \nresult, against an original BE expenditure of `30.42 lakh  crores for 2020 -\n2021, our RE estimates are `34.50 lakh crores. We have maintained the 26 \n \n \n \nquality of expenditure. The capital expenditure, estimated in RE is ` 4.39 \nlakh crores in 2020-2021 as against `4.12 lakh crores in BE 2020-21. \n \n141. The fiscal deficit in RE  2020-21 is pegged at 9.5% of GDP. We have \nfunded this through Government borrowings, multilateral borrowings, Small \nSaving Funds and short term borrowings. We would need another ` 80,000 \ncrores for which we would be approaching the markets in these 2 months. \nTo ensure that the economy is given the required push, our BE estimates for \nexpenditure in 2021-2022, are `34.83 lakh crores. This includes ` 5.54 lakh \ncrores as capital expenditure, an incr ease of  34.5% over the BE figure of \n2020-2021. The fiscal deficit in BE 2021 -2022 is estimated to be 6.8% of \nGDP. The gross borrowing from the market for the next year would be \naround `12 lakh crores. We plan to continue with our path of fiscal \nconsolidation, and intend to reach a fiscal deficit level below 4.5% of GDP by \n2025-2026 with a fairly steady decline over the period. We hope to achieve \nthe consolidation by first, increasing the buoyancy of tax revenue through \nimproved compliance, and secondly, by increased receipts from \nmonetisation of assets, including Public Sector Enterprises and land.  The \nContingency Fund of India is being proposed to be augmented from `500 \ncrores to `30,000 crores through Finance Bill. \n  \n \n142. In accordance with the views of the 15 th Finance Commission, we \nare allowing a normal ceiling of net borrowing for the states at 4% of GSDP \nfor the year 2021 -2022. A portion of this ceiling will be earmarked to be \nspent on incremental capital expenditure. Additional borrowing ceiling of \n0.5% o f GSDP will also be provided subject to conditions. States will be \nexpected to reach a fiscal deficit of 3% of GSDP by 2023 -24, as \nrecommended by the 15th Finance Commission. \n \n143.  In the July 2019 -2020 Budget, I introduced the Statement 27 on \nExtra Budgetary Resources \u2013 it disclosed the borrowings of Government \nagencies that went towards funding GoI schemes, and whose repayment \nburden was on the Government. In my 2020 -2021 Budget, I enhanced the \nscope and coverage of the Statement, by including the loans provi ded by \nGovernment to the FCI. Taking a step further in this direction , I   propose to \ndiscontinue the NSSF Loan to FCI for Food Subsidy and accordingly Budget \nProvisions have been made in RE 2020-21 and BE 2021 -22. The Extra \nBudgetary Resources details are at Annexure VI. 27 \n \n \n \n144. We know that the FRBM Act mandates fiscal deficit of 3% of GDP to \nbe achieved by 31 st March 2020-2021. The effect of this year\u2019s unforeseen \nand unprecedented circumstances has necessitated the submission of a \ndeviation statement under Sect ions 4 (5) and 7 (3) (b) of the FRBM Act \nwhich I am laying on the Table of the House as part of the FRBM \nDocuments. \n \n145. Towards achieving Central Government fiscal deficit along the broad \npath that I have already indicated; I will be introducing an amendment to \nthe FRBM Act. \n \n146. On 9th December 2020, the 15 th Finance Commission submitted its \nfinal report, covering the period 2021 -2026 to the Rashtrapati ji. The \nGovernment has laid the Commission\u2019s report, along with the explanatory \nmemorandum in the Parliament retaining the vertical shares of the states at \n41%. We recognise our commitment to fiscal federalism and propose \ntherefore to adhere to this recommendation. Jammu and Kashmir in the \n14th Finance Commission was entitled to get devolution being a State. Now, \nthe funds to the UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh would be provided \nby the Centre. I have also provided, on the Commission\u2019s recommendation, \n`1,18,452 crores as Revenue Deficit Grant to 17 states in 2021 -2022, as \nagainst `74,340 crores to 14 States in 2020-2021.  \n \nI would, now, move to Part B of my speech. 28 \n \nPART B \n147. Honourable Speaker, the world is facing a serious challenge of the \npandemic and its aftershock. In these trying times, when many economies \nare struggling to revive, our people and our industry have exhibited \nremarkable resilience. \n \n148. As I mentioned already, post-pandemic, a new world order seems to \nbe emerging, one in which Asia is poised to occupy a prominent position \nand India will have a leading role therein.  In this scenario, our tax system \nhas to be transparent, efficient, and sh ould promote investments and \nemployment in our country. At the same time it should put minimum \nburden on our tax payers.  \n \n\u0b87\u0baf\u0082\u0bb1\u00b4\u007f \u0b88y\u0b9f\u00b4u \u0b95\u0bbe{\u0ba4\u00b4\u007f \u0b95\u0bbe{\u0ba4  \n\u0bb5\u0094{\u0ba4\u00b4\u007f \u0bb5\u0083\u0bb2 \u0ba4\u0bb0\u0098. \n- \u0ba4\u0bbf\u00aft\u0094\u0bb1\u0084  385 \n \nA King/Ruler is the one who creates and acquires wealth, \nprotects and distributes it for common good. \n- Thirukkural 385 \n \nDirect Tax Proposals \n149. Keeping this in mind, our Government introduced a series of reforms \nin the Direct tax system for the benefit of our taxpayers and economy.  Few \nmonths prior to the pandemic,   in order to attract investments  we slashed \nour Corporate tax rate to make it among the lowest in the world. The \nDividend Distribution Tax too was abolished. The burden of taxation on \nsmall taxpayers was eased by increasing rebates. In 2020, the return f ilers \nsaw a dramatic increase to  6.48 crore from  3.31 crore in 2014. \n \n150. In the Direct Tax administration, we had recently introduced the \nFaceless Assessment and Faceless Appeal. I now seek to take further steps \nto simplify the tax administration, ease compliance, and reduce litigation.  \n 29 \n \nRelief to Senior Citizens \n151. I begin my direct tax proposals by offering my pranaam to our senior \ncitizens. Many of them, despite having foregone several basic necessities of \ntheir own, have strived to build our nation. \n \n152. Now in the 75 th year of Independence of our country, when we \ncontinue our  endeavour with renewed vigour, we shall reduce compliance \nburden on our senior citizens who are 75 years of age and above. For senior \ncitizens who only have pension and interest incom e, I propose exemption \nfrom filing their income tax returns. The paying bank will deduct the \nnecessary tax on their income.  \n \nReduction in Time for Income Tax Proceedings \n153. Honourable Speaker, presently, an assessment can be re -opened up \nto 6 years and in serious tax fraud cases for up to 10 years. As a result, \ntaxpayers have to remain under uncertainty for a long time.  \n \n154. I therefore propose to reduce this time -limit for re -opening of \nassessment to 3 years from the present 6 years. In serious tax evasion cases \ntoo, only where there is evidence of concealment of income of  `50 lakh or \nmore in a year, can the assessment be re -opened up to 10 years. Even this \nreopening can be don e only after the approval of the Principal Chief \nCommissioner, the highest level of the Income Tax Department.  \n \nSetting up the Dispute Resolution Committee \n155. Honourable Speaker, it has been the resolve of this Government to \nreduce litigation, which mars the  present taxation system.   \n \n156. The Government came out with the Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas \nScheme to give taxpayers an opportunity to settle long pending disputes \nand be relieved of further strain on their time and resources. The response  \nfrom the taxpayer s has been the best ever as  over 1 lakh ten thousand  \ntaxpayers have already opted to settle tax disputes of over  `85,000 crores \nunder this Scheme. \n \n 30 \n \n157. To further reduce litigation for small taxpayers, I propose to \nconstitute a Dispute Resolution Committee  for them, which will be faceless \nto ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability. Anyone with a taxable \nincome up to  `50 lakh and disputed income up to  `10 lakh shall be eligible \nto approach the Committee. \n \nFaceless ITAT \n158. For ease of compliance and to reduce discretion, we  are committed \nto make the taxation processes faceless . The Government has already \nintroduced faceless assessment and appeal this year. \n \n159. The next level of income tax appeal is the Income Tax Appellate \nTribunal.  I now propose to make this Tribunal faceless. We shall establish a \nNational Faceless Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Centre. All communication \nbetween the Tribunal and the appellant shall be electronic. Where personal \nhearing is needed, it shall be d one through video -conferencing.  \n \nRelaxation to NRI  \n160. When Non -Resident Indians return to India, they have issues with \nrespect to their accrued incomes in their foreign retirement accounts. This \nis usually due to a mismatch in taxation periods.  They also f ace difficulties \nin getting credit for Indian taxes in foreign jurisdictions. I propose t o notify \nrules for removing their  hardship of double taxation.  \n \nExemption from Audit \n161. Currently, if your turnover exceeds  `1 crore, you have to get your \naccounts audited. In the February 2020 Budget, I had increased the limit for \ntax audit to  `5 crore for those who carry out 95% of their transactions \ndigitally. To further incentivise digital transactions and reduce compliance \nburden, I propose to increase this limit f or tax audit for such persons from  \n`5 crore to  `10 crore. \nRelief for Dividend \n162. In the previous Budget, I had abolished the Dividend Distribution Tax \n(DDT) in order to incentivise investment. Dividend was made taxable in the 31 \n \nhands of shareholders. Now, in order to provide ease of compliance, I \npropose to make dividend payment to REIT/ InvIT exempt from TDS. \nFurther, as the amount of dividend income cannot be estimated correctly \nby the shareholders for paying advance tax, I propose to provide that \nadvance ta x liability on dividend income shall arise only after the \ndeclaration/payment of dividend. Also, for Foreign Portfolio Investors, I \npropose to enable deduction of tax on dividend income at lower treaty rate.  \nAttracting foreign investment into infrastructure sector \n163. In the last budget, for attracting foreign investment in the \ninfrastructure sector, we had granted 100% tax exemption, subject to \ncertain conditions, to foreign Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds, \non their income from investment in Indian i nfrastructure. We have noticed \nthat few of such Funds are facing difficulties in meeting some of these \nconditions. In order to ensure that a large number of Funds invest in India, I \npropose to relax some of these conditions relating to prohibition on priva te \nfunding, restriction on commercial activities, and direct investment in \ninfrastructure.     \n \n164. In order to allow funding of infrastructure by issue of Zero Coupon \nBonds, I propose to make notified Infrastructure Debt Funds eligible to raise \nfunds by issuing tax efficient Zero Coupon Bonds.  \n \nAffordable Housing/Rental Housing \n165. This Government sees \u2018Housing for All\u2019 and affordable housing as \npriority areas. In the July 2019 Budget, I provided an additional deduction of \ninterest, amounting to  `1.5 lakh, for loan taken to purchase an affordable \nhouse. I propose to extend the eligibility of this deduction by one more \nyear, to 31st March 2022. The additional deduction of  `1.5 lakh shall \ntherefore be available for loans taken up till 31 st March 202 2, for the \npurchase of an affordable house. \n \n166. Further, to keep up the supply of affordable houses, I propose that \naffordable housing projects can avail a tax holiday for one more year \u2013 till \n31st March, 2022. \n 32 \n \n167. We are committed to promote supply of Affordable Rental Housing \nfor migrant workers. For this, I propose to allow  tax exemption for notified \nAffordable Rental Housing Projects.  \n \nTax incentives to IFSC \n168. As I mentioned in Part A of this speech, the Government is \ncommitted to make the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT \nCity a global financial hub. In addition to the tax incentives already \nprovided, I propose to include, among others, tax holiday for capital gains \nfor aircraft leasing companies, tax exempti on for aircraft lease rentals paid \nto foreign lessors; tax incentive for relocating foreign funds in the IFSC; and \nto  allow tax exemption to the investment division of foreign banks located \nin IFSC.  \nPre-filling of Returns \n169. Honourable Speaker, in order to ease compliance for the taxpayer, \ndetails of salary income, tax payments, TDS, etc. already come pre -filled in \nincome tax returns. To further ease filing of returns, details of capital gains \nfrom listed securities, dividend income, and interest from banks, post office, \netc. will also be pre-filled. \n \nRelief to Small Trusts \n170. We hope to reduce compliance burden on small  charitable trusts \nrunning  educational institutions and hospitals. So far, there is a blanket \nexemption to such entities, whose annual receipt  does not exceed   \n`1 crore. I now propose to increase this amount to  `5 crore. \n \nLabour Welfare \n171. We have noticed that some employers deduct the contribution of \nemployees towards  Provident  funds, superannuation funds,  and other \nsocial security funds but do not deposit these contributions within the \nspecified time. For the employees, this means a loss of interest or income. \nIn cases where an employer later becomes financial ly unviable, non-deposit \nresults in a permanent loss for the employees. 33 \n \n172. In order to ensure that employees\u2019 contributions are deposited on \ntime, I reiterate that the late deposit of employee\u2019s contribution by the \nemployer will not be allowed as deduction to the employer. \n \nIncentives for Start-ups \n173. In order to incentivise  start -ups in the country, I propose to extend \nthe eligibility for claiming tax holiday for start -ups by one more year - till \n31st March, 2022. Further, in order to incentivise funding of the start -ups, I \npropose to extend the capital gains exemption for investment in start -ups \nby one more year - till 31st March, 2022. \nIndirect Tax Proposals \nGST  \n174. Before I come to my Indirect Tax proposals, I would like to appraise \nthe House on GST. The GST is now four years old, and we have taken several \nmeasures to further simplify it. Some of the measures include: \ni. nil return through SMS,  \nii. quarterly return and monthly payment for small taxpayers,  \niii. electronic invoice system,  \niv. validated input tax statement,  \nv. pre-filled editable GST return, and  \nvi. staggering of returns filing.  \nThe capacity of GSTN system has also been enhanced.  We have also \ndeployed deep analytics and Artificial Intelligence to identi fy tax evaders \nand fake billers and launched special drives against them.  \n175. The results speak for themselves. We have made record collections \nin the last few months. \n \n176. The GST  Council has painstakingly thrashed out thorny issues. As \nChairperson of the Council, I want to assure the House that we shall take \nevery possible measure to smoothen the GST further, and remove \nanomalies such as the inverted duty structure. \n \nCustom Duty Rationalization \n177. Our Custom Duty Policy should have the twin objective of promoting \ndomestic manufacturing and helping India get onto global value chain and 34 \n \nexport better. The thrust now has to be on easy access to raw materials and \nexports of value added products. \n \n178. Towards this, last year, we started overhauling the Customs Duty \nstructure, eliminating 80 outdated exemptions.  I also thank everyone who \nresponded overwhelmingly to a crowd -sourcing call for suggestions on this \nrevamp. I now propose to review mo re than 400 old exemptions this year.  \nWe will conduct this through extensive consultations, and from 1 st October \n2021, we will put in place a revised customs duty structure, free of \ndistortions. I also propose that any new customs duty exemption \nhenceforth will have validity up to the 31st March following two years from \nthe date of its issue. \n \nElectronic and Mobile Phone Industry \n179. Domestic electronic manufacturing has grown rapidly. We are now \nexporting items like mobiles and chargers. For greater domestic value \naddition, we are withdrawing a few exemptions on parts of chargers and \nsub-parts of mobiles. Further, some parts of mobiles will move from \u2018nil\u2019 \nrate to a moderate 2.5%.  \n \nIron and Steel \n180. MSMEs and other user industries have been severely hit by a recent \nsharp rise in iron and steel prices.  Therefore, we are reducing Customs duty \nuniformly to 7.5% on semis, flat, and long products of non -alloy, alloy, and \nstainless steels. To provide relief to metal re -cyclers, mostly MSMEs, I am \nexempting duty on steel scrap for a period up to 31 st March, 2022.  Further, \nI am also revoking ADD and CVD on certain steel products. Also, to provide \nrelief to copper recyclers, I am reducing duty on copper scrap from  5% to \n2.5%. \n \nTextile \n181. The Textiles Sector generates employment and contributes \nsignificantly to the economy. There is a need to rationalize duties on raw \nmaterial inputs to manmade textiles.  We are now bringing nylon chain on \npar with polyester and other man-made fibers. We are uniformly reducing 35 \n \nthe BCD rates on caprolactam, nylon chips and nylon fiber & yarn to 5%. \nThis will help the textile industry, MSMEs, and exports, too.  \n \nChemicals  \n182. We have calibrated customs duty rates on chemicals to encourage \ndomestic value addition and to remove inversions.  Apart from other items, \nwe are reducing customs duty on Naptha to 2.5% to correct inversion. \nGold and Silver \n183. Gold and silver presently attract a basic customs duty of 12.5%. \nSince the duty was raised from 10%  in July 2019, prices of precious metals \nhave risen sharply. To bring it closer to previous levels, we are rationalizing \ncustom duty on gold and silver.  \n \nRenewable Energy \n184. In Part A, we have already acknowledged that solar energy has huge \npromise for India . To build up domestic capacity, we will notify a phased \nmanufacturing plan for solar cells and solar panels. At present, to encourage \ndomestic production, we are raising duty on solar invertors from 5% to 20%, \nand on solar lanterns from 5% to 15%. \n \nCapital Equipment and Auto Parts \n185. There is immense potential in manufacturing heavy capital \nequipment domestically. We will comprehensively review the rate structure \nin due course. However, we are revising duty rates on certain items \nimmediately.  We propose to withdraw exemptions on tunnel boring \nmachine. It will attract a customs duty of 7.5%; and its parts a duty of 2.5%. \nWe are raising customs duty on certain auto parts to 15% to bring them on \npar with general rate on auto parts.  \nMSME Products \n186. We are proposin g certain changes to benefit MSMEs. We are \nincreasing duty from 10% to 15% on steel screws and plastic builder wares. \nOn prawn feed we increase it from 5% to 15%. We are rationalizing \nexemption on import of duty -free items as an incentive to exporters of 36 \n \ngarments, leather, and handicraft items. Almost all these items are made \ndomestically by our MSMEs. We are withdrawing exemption on imports of \ncertain kind of leathers as they are domestically produced in good quantity \nand quality, mostly by MSMEs. We are a lso raising customs duty on finished \nsynthetic gem stones to encourage their domestic processing.  \n \nAgriculture Products \n187. To benefit farmers, we are raising customs duty on cotton from nil \nto 10% and on raw silk and silk yarn from 10% to 15%. We are also \nwithdrawing end -use based concession on denatured ethyl alcohol. \nCurrently, rates are being uniformly calibrated to 15% on items like maize \nbran, rice bran oil cake, and animal feed additives. \n \n188.  There is an immediate need to improve agricultural infrastruc ture \nso that we produce more, while also conserving and processing agricultural \noutput efficiently. This will ensure enhanced remuneration for our farmers. \nTo earmark resources for this purpose, I propose an Agriculture \nInfrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) on a small number of items. \nHowever, while applying this cess, we have taken care not to put additional \nburden on consumers on most items. \n \nRationalization of Procedures and Easing of Compliance  \n189. For their judicious application, we propose certain changes in the \nprovisions relating to ADD and CVD levies. To complete Customs \ninvestigations, we are prescribing definite timelines. In 2020, we rolled out \nthe Turant Customs initiative, which brought in Faceless, Paperless, and \nContactless Customs measures. With effect from September 2020, we  have \nimplemented a new procedure for administration of Rules of Origin. This \nhas helped in putting a check on misuse of FTAs. \n \n190. The specific details of direct and  in direct tax changes proposed are \nlisted in the Annexure to my speech. \n \n191. Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words I commend the Budget to this \naugust House. \n 37 \n \nAnnex to Part A of Budget Speech \nANNEXURE-I \nHealth and Wellbeing \u2013 Expenditure  \n(In  ` crores) \nMinistry/Department Actuals \n2019-20 \nBE  \n2020-21 \nBE  \n2021-22 \nD/o Health & Family Welfare 62,397 65,012 71,269 \nD/o Health Research 1,934 2,100 2,663 \nM/o AYUSH 1,784 2,122 2,970 \nCoVID related Special Provisions       \nVaccination     35,000 \nD/o Drinking Water & Sanitation 18,264 21,518 60,030 \nNutrition 1,880 3,700 2,700 \nFC Grants for Water and Sanitation     36,022 \nFC Grants for Health     13,192 \nTOTAL 86,259 94,452 2,23,846 \n \n \n  38 \n \nANNEXURE-II \nFlagship Projects: Roads and Highways \nMajor Expressways/Corridors \n\uf0b7 Delhi-Mumbai Expressway: Remaining 260 km will be awarded \nbefore 31.3.2021. \n\uf0b7 Bengaluru \u2013 Chennai Expressway: 278 km will be initiated in the \ncurrent financial year.

This will enhance \nthe capabilities of teachers and will be followed by all 92 lakh teachers \nof public and private school system in the country.   \n\uf0b7 Toys are both an expression of entertainment and learning.  A unique \nindigenous toy -based learning \u2013 pedagogy for all levels of school \neducation will be developed.  This will transform classroom \ntransactions from mundane and rote learning to an e ngaging and \njoyful experience.  \n\uf0b7 A National Digital Educational Architecture (NDEAR ) will be set up \nwithin the context of a Digital First Mindset where the Digital \nArchitecture will not only support teaching and learning activities but \nalso educational planning, governance and administrative activities of \nthe Centre and the States/ Union  Territories.  It will provide a diverse \neducation eco -system architecture for development of digital \ninfrastructure, a federated but inter operable system that will ensure \nautonomy of all stakeholders, specially States and UTs.  \n\uf0b7 For children with hearing impairments, the Government will work on \nstandardization of Indian Sign language across the country, and \ndevelop National and State Curriculum materials for use by them.   \n\uf0b7 There are a number of senior and retired teachers.  They will be used \nfor individual  mentoring of school teachers and educators through \nconstant online/offline support on subjects, themes and pedagogy. \n\uf0b7 Students have so far been evaluated on uni -dimensional parameters.  \nThere will be a complete shift from using assessments to not only \njudge the cognitive levels of the learner but also using it as an \nopportunity to identify the unique strengths and the potential of the \nchild. To this effect, a holistic progress card is envisaged to provide \nstudents with valuable information on their strength s, areas of \ninterest, needed areas of focus and thereby helping them in making \noptimal career choices.    \n\uf0b7 To enable increased access of resources, online modules covering the \nentire gamut of adult education will be introduced.   \n\uf0b7 During the year, despite th e COVID -19 pandemic, we have trained \nmore than 30 lakh elementary school teachers digitally, covering the 42 \n \nwhole gamut of education.   Taking this further, in 2021 -22, we will \nenable the training of 56 lakh school teachers through the National \nInitiative fo r School Heads and Teachers for Holistic Advancement \n(NISTHA). \n\uf0b7 For the past few years our Prime Minister has been engaging with \nstudents every year before their Board Exams to help them overcome \nanxiety and stress.  In this direction, we will introduce CBS E Board \nExam reforms in a phased manner to be effective from the 2022 -23 \nacademic session.  Exams will move away from rote -learning and \nstudents shall be tested on their conceptual clarity, analytical skills and \napplication of knowledge to real life situations.  \n\uf0b7 To promote enhanced academic collaboration with foreign higher \neducational institutions, it is proposed to put in place a regulatory \nmechanism to permit dual degrees, joint degrees, twinning \narrangements and other such mechanisms.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 43 \n \nANNEXURE VI \nStatement of Extra Budgetary Resources (EBRs) (Govt. fully serviced bonds, NSSF loan and other resources)  \n                                                                                                                                                   (In  ` crores) \nPart-A \u2013 EBRs mobilised through issue of Govt. fully serviced bonds    \nDemand \nNo.  \nName of the Ministry/Department \nand Name of the Scheme \n2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20  2020-21 2020-21 2021-22 \nActuals Actuals Actuals Actuals BE RE BE \n24 Department of Higher Education         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNIL \n Revitalising Infrastructure and \nSystems in Education (RISE) \n--- --- --- --- 3000.00 --- \n44 Department of Health & Family \nWelfare \n      \nPradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha \nYojana \n--- --- --- --- 3000.00 --- \n59 Ministry of Housing & Urban \nAffairs \n      \n Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana \n(PMAY) - Urban \n--- --- 20000.00 --- 10000.00 --- \n61 Department of Water Resources, \nRiver Development & Ganga \nRejuvenation \n      \n  Polavaram Irrigation Project --- --- 1400.00 1850.00 --- 2234.29 \n \n4225.00  (ii) Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana  \n(Accelerated Irrigation Benefits \nProgramme & other Projects) \n \n2187.00 \n \n3105.00 \n \n5493.40 \n \n1963.30 \n \n5000.00 \n62 Department of Drinking Water & \nSanitation \n      \n Swachh Bharat Mission (Rural)  \n Jal Jeevan Mission/National Rural \nDrinking Water Programme \n--- \n--- \n--- \n--- \n8698.20 \n--- \n3600.00 \n--- \n---- \n12000.00 \n--- \n--- \n70 Ministry of New & Renewable \nEnergy \n      \n Grid Interactive Renewable Power, \nOff-Grid/ Distributed & Decentralized \nRenewable Power \n1640.00 \n \n--- \n \n \n--- \n \n \n--- \n \n \n--- --- \n  Pradhan Mantri-Kisan Urja \nSanrakshan Evam Utthan \nMahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) \n--- --- --- --- 1000.00 --- \n77 Ministry of Ports, Shipping and \nWaterways \n      \nInland Waterways Authority of India \n(IWAI) Projects \n340.00 660.00 --- ---- --- --- \n78 Ministry of Power        \n  Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti \nYojana/SAUBHAGYA \n5000.00 4000.00 13827.00 3782.00 5500.00 5000.00 \n(ii)  Power System Development Fund \nProjects \n---  5504.70 --- --- --- \n86 Department of Rural Development        \nPradhan Mantri Awas Yojana \n(PMAY) - Rural \n--- 7330.00 10678.80 10811.00 10000.00 20000.00 \n  Total 9167.00 15095.00 65602.10 22006.30 49500.00 31459.29 \n  44 \n \n \nPart-B \u2013 Financial support extended through loans from NSSF \n(In  ` crores) \n  # NSSF loan amount outstanding with FCI as on 31.03.2020 was ` 2,54,600 crore. \n \nNotes : \n \n(i) Air India Asset Holding Limited (AIAHL) under M/o Civil Aviation was permitted to raise \nEBRs by issuing Govt.
