    "content": " \n \npolicy interventions to create a congenial atmosphere for the \ndevelopment of MRO in the country.  \n16. The New Metro Rail Projects for a total route length of 300 \nkilometers have been approved during 2018-19. Also, during 2019, about \n210 kms metro lines have been operationalized. With this, 657 kms of \nMetro Rail network has become operational across the country.  \n17. India\u2019s first indigenously developed payment ecosystem for \ntransport, based on National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) standards, \nwas launched by Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister in March, 2019. This will enable \npeople to pay multiple kinds of transport charges, including metro services \nand toll tax, across the country. This inter-operable transport card runs on \nRuPay card and would allow the holders to pay for their bus travel, toll \ntaxes, parking charges, retail shopping and even withdraw money.  \n18. Phase-II of FAME Scheme, following approval of the Cabinet with \nan outlay of \n10,000 crore for a period of 3 years, has commenced from \n1st April, 2019. The main objective of the Scheme is to encourage faster \nadoption of Electric vehicles by way of offering upfront incentive on \npurchase of Electric vehicles and also by establishing the necessary \ncharging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Only advanced battery and \nregistered e-vehicles will be incentivized under the Scheme with greater \nemphasis on providing affordable & environment friendly public \ntransportation options for the common man. \n19. The Government will carry out a comprehensive restructuring of \nNational Highway Programme to ensure that the National Highway Grid of \ndesirable length and capacity is created using financeable model. After \ncompleting the Phase 1 of Bharatmala, in the second Phase, States will be \nhelped to develop State road networks. \n20. We need to develop our inland waterways to shift a significant \nportion of inland cargo movement from road and rail. This Government \nenvisions using the rivers for cargo transportation, which will also help to \ndecongest roads and railways. As part of the Jal Marg Vikas Project for \nenhancing the navigational capacity of Ganga, a multi modal terminal at \nVaranasi has become functional in November 2018 and two more such \nterminals at Sahibganj and Haldia and a navigational lock at Farakka would \nbe completed in 2019-20. The movement of cargo volume on Ganga is \nestimated to increase by nearly four times in the next four years. This will \nmake movement of freight, passenger cheaper and reduce our import bill.   \n \n21. It is estimated that Railway Infrastructure would need an \ninvestment of  50 lakh crores between 2018-2030.  Given that the capital \nexpenditure outlays of Railways are around 1.5 to 1.6 lakh crores per \nannum, completing even all sanctioned projects would take decades.  It is \ntherefore proposed to use Public-Private Partnership to unleash faster \ndevelopment and completion of tracks, rolling stock manufacturing and \ndelivery of passenger freight services.  \n22. To take connectivity infrastructure to the next level, we will build \non the successful model in ensuring power connectivity \u2013 One Nation, One \nGrid \u2013 that has ensured power availability to states at affordable rates. I \npropose to make available a blueprint this year for developing gas grids, \nwater grids, i-ways, and regional airports. \n23. The recommendations of the High Level Empowered Committee \n(HLEC) on retirement of old & inefficient plants, and addressing low \nutilisation of Gas plant capacity due to paucity of Natural Gas, will also be \ntaken up for implementation now. \n24. Our Government launched Ujjwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana \n(UDAY) in 2015 aimed at financial and operational turnaround of \nDISCOMs. Government is examining the performance of the Scheme and \nit will be further improved. We will work with the State Governments to \nremove barriers like cross subsidy surcharges, undesirable duties on open \naccess sales or captive generation for Industrial and other bulk power \nconsumers. Besides these structural reforms, considerable reforms are \nneeded in tariff policy. A package of power sector tariff and structural \nreforms would soon be announced.  \n25. It is proposed that several reform measures would be taken up to \npromote rental housing. Current Rental Laws are archaic as they do not \naddress the relationship between the Lessor and the Lessee realistically \nand fairly. A Model Tenancy Law will also be finalized and circulated to the \nStates. \n26. Large public infrastructure can be built on land parcels held by \nCentral Ministries and Central Public Sector Enterprises all across the \ncountry. Through innovative instruments such as joint development and \nconcession, public infrastructure and affordable housing will be taken up.   \n \n27. For ease of access to credit for MSMEs, Government has \nintroduced providing of loans upto 1 crore for MSMEs within 59 minutes \nthrough a dedicated online portal. Under the Interest Subvention Scheme \nfor MSMEs,  350 crore has been allocated for FY 2019-20 for 2% interest \nsubvention for all GST registered MSMEs, on fresh or incremental loans.  \n28. Government payments to suppliers and contractors are a major \nsource of cash flow, especially to SMEs and MSMEs.  Investment in \nMSMEs will receive a big boost if these delays in payment are eliminated. \nGovernment will create a payment platform for MSMEs to enable filing of \nbills and payment thereof on the platform itself. \n29. Encouraged by the overwhelming response, the Government of \nIndia has decided to extend the pension benefit to about three crore retail \ntraders & small shopkeepers whose annual turnover is less than 1.5 crore \nunder a new Scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Karam Yogi Maandhan \nScheme. Enrolment into the Scheme will be kept simple requiring only \nAadhaar and a bank account and rest will be on self-declaration.  \n30. We recognize that investment-driven growth requires access to \nlow cost capital.  It is estimated that India requires investments averaging \n 20 lakh crores every year (USD 300 billion a year).  A number of \nmeasures are proposed to enhance the sources of capital for \ninfrastructure financing:  \n\uf0b7 A Credit Guarantee Enhancement Corporation for which \nregulations have been notified by the RBI, will be set up in 2019-\n20.  \n\uf0b7 An action plan to deepen the market for long term bonds including \nfor deepening markets for corporate bond repos, credit default \nswaps etc., with specific focus on infrastructure sector, will be put \nin place.  \n\uf0b7 It is proposed to permit investments made by FIIs/FPIs in debt \nsecurities issued by Infrastructure Debt Fund \u2013 Non-Bank Finance \nCompanies (IDF-NBFCs) to be transferred/sold to any domestic \ninvestor within the specified lock-in period. \n31. Corporate Debt markets are crucial for the infrastructure sector.  \nGiven the need to further deepen bond markets, a number of measures \nare proposed to be taken up:-   \n \n\uf0b7 To deepen the Corporate tri-party repo market in Corporate Debt \nsecurities, Government will work with regulators RBI/SEBI to \nenable stock exchanges to allow AA rated bonds as collaterals.  \n\uf0b7 User-friendliness of trading platforms for corporate bonds will be \nreviewed, including issues arising out of capping of International \nSecurities Identification Number (ISIN).  \n32. It is right time to consider increasing minimum public shareholding \nin the listed companies. I have asked SEBI to consider raising the current \nthreshold of 25% to 35%.  \n33. As a key source of capital to the Indian economy, it is important to \nensure a harmonized and hassle free investment experience for Foreign \nPortfolio Investors. Hence, it is proposed to rationalize and streamline the \nexisting Know Your Customer (KYC) norms for FPIs to make it more \ninvestor friendly without compromising the integrity of cross-border \ncapital flows. \n34. It is time to take our capital markets closer to the masses and meet \nvarious social welfare objectives related to inclusive growth and financial \ninclusion.  I propose to initiate steps towards creating an electronic fund \nraising platform \u2013 a social stock exchange - under the regulatory ambit of \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for listing social enterprises \nand voluntary organizations working for the realization of a social welfare \nobjective so that they can raise capital as equity, debt or as units like a \nmutual fund. \n35. It is important to get retail investors to invest in treasury bills and \nsecurities issued by the Government. Efforts made by the Reserve Bank \nwill need to be supplemented with further institutional development using \nstock exchanges. For this purpose, inter-operability of RBI depositories and \nSEBI depositories would be necessary to bring about seamless transfer of \ntreasury bills and government securities between RBI and Depository \nledgers and for enabling this. The Government will take up necessary \nmeasures in this regard in consultation with RBI and SEBI. \n36. FDI inflows into India have remained robust despite global \nheadwinds.  Global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows slid by 13% in \n2018, to US$ 1.3 trillion from US$ 1.5 trillion the previous year \u2013 the third \nconsecutive annual decline, according to UNCTAD\u2019s World Investment \nReport 2019.  India\u2019s FDI inflows in 2018-19 remained strong at US$ \n64.375 billion marking a 6% growth over the previous year.  I propose to  \n \nfurther consolidate the gains in order to make India a more attractive FDI \ndestination: \na. The Government will examine suggestions of further opening up of \nFDI in aviation, media (animation, AVGC) and insurance sectors in \nconsultation with all stakeholders.  \nb. 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will be permitted for \ninsurance intermediaries.  \nc. Local sourcing norms will be eased for FDI in Single Brand Retail \nsector.   \n37. It is high time India not only gets integrated into global value chain \nof production of goods and services, but also become part of the global \nfinancial system to mobilise global savings, mostly institutionalized in \npension, insurance and sovereign wealth funds. The Government is \ncontemplating organizing an annual Global Investors Meet in India, using \nNational Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF) as the anchor, to get all \nthree sets of global players-top industrialists/corporate honchos, top \npension/insurance/sovereignwealth funds and top digital \ntechnology/venture funds. \n38. An important determinant of attracting cross-border investments \nis availability of investible stock to the Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). \nThis issue assumes greater significance in view of the gradual shift, from \nstock targeted investments, towards passive investment whereby funds \ntrack global indices composition of which depends upon available floating \nstock. Accordingly, I propose to increase the statutory limit for FPI \ninvestment in a company from 24% to sectoral foreign investment limit \nwith option given to the concerned corporates to limit it to a lower \nthreshold. FPIs will be permitted to subscribe to listed debt securities \nissued by ReITs and InvITs. \n39. Even though India is the world's top remittance recipient, NRI \ninvestment in Indian capital markets is comparatively less. With a view to \nprovide NRIs with seamless access to Indian equities, I propose to merge \nthe NRI-Portfolio Investment Scheme Route with the Foreign Portfolio \nInvestment Route.  \n \n40. New and innovative financial instruments have been launched in \nthe last five years like Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), Real \nEstate Investment Trusts (REITs) as well as models like Toll-Operate-\nTransfer (ToT) as part of the brownfield asset modernization strategy for \naugmenting infrastructure investment. India has had a reasonable success \nin brownfield asset monetization and several InvITs and one REIT \ntransaction have already been completed. Additionally, NHAI carried out \none ToT transaction as well. The cumulative resources garnered through \nthese instruments and model exceed \n 24,000 crore. \n41. India has emerged as a major space power with the technology \nand ability to launch satellites and other space products at globally low \ncost. Time has come to harness this ability commercially. A Public Sector \nEnterprise viz. New Space India Limited (NSIL) has been incorporated as a \nnew commercial arm of Department of Space to tap the benefits of the \nResearch & Development carried out by ISRO. The Company will \nspearhead commercialization of various space products including \nproduction of launch vehicles, transfer to technologies and marketing of \nspace products. \nGrameen Bharat/Rural India \n42. Mahatma Gandhi said, \u201cThe soul of India lives in its villages\u201d. This \nyear even as we are marking the 150 th birth anniversary of Mahatma \nGandhi, I submit that our Government keeps Antyodaya at the core of all \nits efforts. At the Centre of everything that we do, we keep \u201cgaon, garib, \naur kisan\u201d. \n43. Hon'ble Prime Minister's two mega initiatives of Ujjwala Yojana \nand Saubhagya Yojana - have transformed the lives of every rural family, \ndramatically improving ease of their living. Household access to clean \ncooking gas has seen an unprecedented expansion, through provision of \nmore than 7 crore LPG connections. All villages, and almost 100% \nhouseholds across the country have been provided with electricity. A \ncombination of efficient implementation and enthusiastic adoption has \nsignificantly improved access to energy for rural households. By 2022, the \n75th year of India\u2019s independence, I would like to assure the nation that \nevery single rural family, except those who are unwilling to take the \nconnection will have an electricity and a clean cooking facility.  \n \n44. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana \u2013 Gramin (PMAY-G) aims to achieve \nthe objective of \u201cHousing for All\u201d by 2022. A total of 1.54 crore rural \nhomes have been completed in the last five years. In the second phase of \nPMAY-G, during 2019-20 to 2021-22, 1.95 crore houses are proposed to \nbe provided to the eligible beneficiaries. These houses are also being \nprovided with amenities like toilets, electricity and LPG connections. With \nthe use of technology, the DBT platform and technology inputs, average \nnumber of days for completion of houses has reduced from 314 days in \n2015-16 to 114 days in 2017-18. \n45. Fishing and fishermen communities are closely aligned with \nfarming and are crucial to rural India. Through a focused Scheme \u2013 the \nPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) \u2013 the Department of \nFisheries will establish a robust fisheries management framework. This will \naddress critical gaps in the value chain, including infrastructure, \nmodernization, traceability, production, productivity, post-harvest \nmanagement, and quality control. \n46. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has brought many \nsocio economic gains in the rural areas. To accelerate the speed of \nachieving universal connectivity of eligible habitations, the target of \nconnecting the eligible and feasible habitations was advanced from 2022 \nto 2019. I am happy to inform that all weather connectivity has now been \nprovided to over 97% of such habitations. This has been possible by \nmaintaining a high pace of road construction of 130 to 135 km per day in \nthe last 1,000 days. Committed to the agenda of sustainable development, \n30,000 kms of PMGSY roads have been built using Green Technology, \nWaste Plastic and Cold Mix Technology, thereby reducing carbon \nfootprint. With the changing economic scenario, it is important to upgrade \nroads connecting villages to rural markets. For this PMGSY-III is envisaged \nto upgrade 1,25,000kms of road length over the next five years, with an \nestimated cost of \n 80,250 crore. \n47. Considering the fact that majority of people still live in villages and \ndepend on agriculture and traditional industries, the \u2018Scheme of Fund for \nUpgradation and Regeneration of Traditional Industries\u2019 (SFURTI) aims to \nset up more Common Facility Centres (CFCs) to facilitate cluster based \ndevelopment to make the traditional industries more productive, \nprofitable and capable for generating sustained employment \nopportunities. The focused sectors are Bamboo, Honey and Khadi clusters. \nThe SFURTI envisions setting up 100 new clusters during 2019-20 which  \n \nshould enable 50,000 artisans to join the economic value chain. Further, \nto improve the technology of such industries, the Scheme for Promotion \nof Innovation, Rural Industry and Entrepreneurship\u2019 (ASPIRE) has been \nconsolidated for setting up of Livelihood Business Incubators (LBIs) and \nTechnology Business Incubators (TBIs). The Scheme contemplates to set \nup 80 Livelihood Business Incubators (LBIs) and 20 Technology Business \nIncubators (TBIs) in 2019-20 to develop 75,000 skilled entrepreneurs in \nagro-rural industry sectors. \n48. We will invest widely in agricultural infrastructure. We will support \nprivate entrepreneurships in driving value-addition to farmers\u2019 produce \nfrom the field and for those from allied activities, like Bamboo and timber \nfrom the hedges and for generating renewable energy. Annadata can also \nbe Urjadata. Dairying through cooperatives shall also be encouraged by \ncreating infrastructure for cattle feed manufacturing, milk procurement, \nprocessing & marketing. I place my appreciation for our farmers who have \nmade India self-sufficient in pulses. I am sure they will repeat such a \nsuccess even in the production of oilseeds. Our import bill shall be \nreduced by their Seva.  \n49. We also hope to form 10,000 new Farmer Producer Organizations, \nto ensure economies of scale for farmers over the next five years. \n50. This Government will work with State Governments to allow \nfarmers to benefit from e-NAM. The Agriculture Produce Marketing \nCooperatives (APMC) Act should not hamper farmers from getting a fair \nprice for their produce. Ease of doing business and ease of living both \nshould apply to farmers too. We shall go back to basics on one count: Zero \nBudget Farming. We need to replicate this innovative model through \nwhich in a few States farmers are already being trained in this practice. \nSteps such as this can help in doubling our farmers\u2019 income in time for our \n75th year of Independence.  \n51. Ensuring India\u2019s water security and providing access to safe and \nadequate drinking water to all Indians is a priority of the Government. A \nmajor step in this direction has been the constitution of the Jal Shakti \nMantralaya, integrating the Ministry of Water Resources, River \nDevelopment and Ganga Rejuvenation and Ministry of Drinking Water and \nSanitation. This new Mantralaya will look at the management of our water \nresources and water supply in an integrated and holistic manner, and will \nwork with States to ensure Har Ghar Jal (piped water supply) to all rural \nhouseholds by 2024 under the Jal Jeevan Mission. This Mission, under the  \n \nDepartment of Drinking Water and Sanitation, will focus on integrated \ndemand and supply side management of water at the local level, including \ncreation of local infrastructure for source sustainability like rainwater \nharvesting, groundwater recharge and management of household \nwastewater for reuse in agriculture. The Jal Jeevan Mission will converge \nwith other Central and State Government Schemes to achieve its \nobjectives of sustainable water supply management across the country. \n52. The Government has identified 1592 Blocks which are critical and \nover exploited, spread across 256 District for the Jal Shakti Abhiyan. \nBesides using funds available under various Schemes, the Government will \nalso explore possibility of using additional funds available under the \nCompensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority \n(CAMPA) for this purpose.  \n53. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has touched the very conscience of the \nnation besides bringing enormous health and environmental benefits. This \nnoble Scheme, initiated in 2014, has achieved a resounding success. 9.6 \ncrore toilets have been constructed since Oct 2, 2014. More than 5.6 lakh \nvillages have become Open Defecation Free (ODF). We have to build on \nthis success. We must not only sustain the behavioural change seen in \npeople but also harness the latest technologies available to transform \nwaste into energy. I now propose to expand the Swachh Bharat Mission to \nundertake sustainable solid waste management in every village. \n54. Under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan, over \ntwo crore rural Indians have so far been made digitally literate. To bridge \nrural-urban digital divide, Bharat-Net is targeting internet connectivity in \nlocal bodies in every Panchayat in the country. This will be speeded up \nwith assistance from Universal Service Obligation Fund and under a Public \nPrivate Partnership arrangement.  \nShahree Bharat/Urban India \n55. This Government sees the rapid urbanization of India as an \nopportunity rather than a challenge. We have to make both our cities and \nvillages better using technology. This way we can help people live closer to \ntheir home, stop migration into cities, provide essential services to all.  \n56. Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana \u2013 Urban (PMAY-Urban), over \n81 lakh houses with an investment of about \n4.83 lakh crores have been \nsanctioned of which construction has started in about 47 lakh houses. \nOver 26 lakh houses have been completed of which nearly 24 lakh houses \nhave been delivered to the beneficiaries. There is large scale adoption of  \n \nnew technologies for construction of these houses. Over 13 lakh houses \nhave so far been constructed using these new technologies.  \n57. More than 95% of cities also have been declared ODF. More than \n45,000 public and community toilets across 1700 cities have been \nuploaded on Google maps, covering more than 53% of India\u2019s urban \npopulation. Almost 1 crore citizens have downloaded Swachhata App. \n58. The 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi is an apt occasion \nfor us to re-dedicate ourselves to the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi. Hon'ble \nPrime Minister took the Sankalp of achieving Gandhiji\u2019s resolve of Swachh \nBharat to make India Open Defecation Free by 2nd October 2019. I am \nvery satisfied and happy to report that this would be achieved by the 2nd \nOctober. To mark this occasion, the Rashtriya Swachhta Kendra will be \ninaugurated at Gandhi Darshan, Rajghat on 2nd October, 2019. A \nGandhipedia is also being developed by National Council for Science \nMuseums to sensitize youth and society at large about positive Gandhian \nvalues. \n59. Indian Railways suburban and long-distance services do a \nphenomenal task in cities like Mumbai and smaller cities. Railways will be \nencouraged to invest more in suburban railways through Special Purpose \nVehicle (SPV) structures like Rapid Regional Transport System (RRTS) \nproposed on the Delhi-Meerut route. I propose to enhance the metro-\nrailway initiatives by encouraging more PPP initiatives and ensuring \ncompletion of sanctioned works, while supporting Transit Oriented \nDevelopment (TOD) to ensure commercial activity around transit hubs. \nWe are in the process of completing the dedicated freight corridor project \nthat will free up some of the existing railway network for passenger trains.  \nYouth \n60. The Government will bring in a New National Education Policy to \ntransform India\u2019s higher education system to one of the global best \neducation systems. The new Policy proposes major changes in both school \nand higher education among others, better Governance systems and \nbrings greater focus on research and innovation. \n61. We propose to establish a National Research Foundation (NRF) to \nfund, coordinate and promote research in the country. NRF will assimilate \nthe research grants being given by various Ministries independent of each \nother. NRF will ensure that the overall research eco-system in the country \nis strengthened  with focus on identified thrust areas relevant to our \nnational priorities and towards basic science without duplication of effort  \n \nand expenditure. We would work out a very progressive and research \noriented structure for NRF. The funds available with all Ministries will be \nintegrated in NRF. This would be adequately supplemented with \nadditional funds.   \n62. Massive online open courses through the SWAYAM initiative have \nhelped bridge the digital divide for disadvantaged section of the student \ncommunity. To up-grade the quality of teaching, the Global Initiative of \nAcademic Networks (GIAN) programme in higher education was started, \naimed at tapping the global pool of scientists and researchers. The \nIMPRINT or IMPacting Research INnovation and Technology scheme \nbegan as a Pan-IIT and IISc joint initiative to develop a roadmap for \nresearch to solve major engineering and technology challenges in selected \ndomains needed by the country. Higher educational institutions are \nbecoming the centres of innovation. \n63. These initiatives have up-graded the quality of education. There \nwas not a single Indian institution in the top 200 in the world university \nrankings five years back. Due to concerted efforts by our institutions to \nboost their standards and also project their credentials better, we have \nthree institutions now \u2013 two IITs and IISc Bangalore \u2013 in the top 200 \nbracket. This window is open now thanks to our efforts. We will continue \nmaking concerted efforts to improve. An amount of \n 400 crore has been \nprovided under the head, \u201cWorld Class Institutions\u201d, for FY 2019-20, more \nthan three times the revised estimates for the previous year. India has the \npotential to become a hub of higher education. I, therefore, propose to \nstart a programme, \u2018Study in India\u2019, that will focus on bringing foreign \nstudents to study in our higher educational institutions.  \n64. The regulatory systems of higher education would be reformed \ncomprehensively to promote greater autonomy and focus on better \nacademic outcomes. A draft legislation for setting up Higher Education \nCommission of India (HECI), would be presented in the year ahead. \n65. Khelo India Scheme, launched in October, 2017, has created \nawareness of sports as an integral part of wellness throughout the \ncountry. The Government is committed to expand Khelo India Scheme and \nto provide all necessary financial support. To popularize sports at all \nlevels, a National Sports Education Board for Development of \nSportspersons would be set up under Khelo India Scheme. \n66. This Government recognizes and follows the teachings of Lord \nBasveshwara, in particular the principles of Kayaka and Dasoha.  \n \nImplementing \u2018Kayakave Kailasa\u2019, the Government enables about 10 \nmillion youth to take up industry-relevant skill training through the \nPradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). This is helping to create a \nlarge pool of skilled manpower with speed and high standards. \nDemographic trends worldwide show that major economies will face \nsevere labour shortages in the future. To prepare our youth to also take \nup jobs overseas, we will increase focus on skill sets needed abroad \nincluding language training. We will also lay focus on new-age skills like \nArtificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things, Big Data, 3D Printing, Virtual \nReality and Robotics, which are valued highly both within and outside the \ncountry, and offer much higher remuneration.  \n67. Drawing again on Lord Basveshwara, his principle of Dasoha \nunderlines most things this Government does. \u2018Give It Up\u2019 for giving up \nLPG subsidy or the various pension schemes are on the principle of sharing \nthrough distribution, for the wellness of the society.  \n68. The Government is proposing to streamline multiple labour laws \ninto a set of four labour codes. This will ensure that process of registration \nand filing of returns will get standardized and streamlined. With various \nlabour related definitions getting standardized, it is expected that there \nshall be less disputes.  \n69. We propose to start a television programme within the DD \nbouquet of channels exclusively for start-ups. This shall serve as a \nplatform for promoting start-ups, discussing issues affecting their growth, \nmatchmaking with venture capitalists and for funding and tax planning. \nThis channel shall be designed and executed by start-ups themselves. \nLater in this speech, I shall deal with taxation matters of the start-ups. \n70. Stand-Up India Scheme has delivered enormous benefits. The \ncountry is witnessing emergence of thousands of entrepreneurs from \nwomen and also from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, most of \nthem assisted to set up their businesses and industry with capital provided \nunder the Stand-Up India Scheme. Considering the beneficial results of the \nScheme and strong demand for its continuance by the SC and ST \ncommunities, the Scheme would be continued for the entire period \ncoinciding with the 15th Finance Commission period of 2020-25. The \nBanks will provide financial assistance for demand based businesses, \nincluding for example for acquisition of scavenging machines and robots. \n71. The Stand Up India Scheme has made human dignity and self-\nesteem go up. \u201cKayakave Kailasa\u201d. The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural  \n \nGas has enabled SC/ST entrepreneurs in providing Bulk LPG \nTransportation. In a matter of two years over 300 entrepreneurs have \nemerged. Machines and robots have been deployed to do scavenging \nwhich also saved the manual scavengers their dignity. The synthesis \nbetween stand up and start up with commercial banks playing the catalyst \nhas brought this transformational change. \nEase of Living \n72. This Government aims to bring greater ease of living in the lives of \nits citizens. Digital payments are gaining acceptance everywhere including \nby the Government. Use of technology is an effective way to ensure this.  \n73. Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan was launched on 5th March, \n2019 by Hon\u2019ble PM at Ahmedabad. The Scheme aims at providing \n3,000 \nper month as pension on attaining the age of 60 to crores of workers in \nunorganized and informal sectors. About 30 lakh workers have joined the \nScheme. \n74. For good quality of life and ease of living, maintaining a cleaner \nenvironment and ensuring sustainable energy use is vital. A programme of \nmass scaling up of LED bulbs for widespread distribution at household \nlevel was taken up resulting into massive replacement of incandescent \nbulbs and CFLs in the country. Approximately 35 crore LED bulbs have \nbeen distributed under UJALA Yojana leading to cost saving of  18,341 \ncrores annually. India is going to be free of incandescent bulbs and CFL use \nhas already become miniscule. We will use the approach of mission LED \nbulb method to promote the use of solar stoves and battery chargers in \nthe country. \n75. To make railway travel a pleasant and satisfying experience for the \ncommon citizen, we will launch a massive programme of railway station \nmodernization this year. \nNaari Tu Narayani/Women \n76. Swami Vivekananda in a letter to Swami Ramakrishnanda had said: \n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of \nwomen is improved. It is not possible for a bird to fly on one wing\u201d. This \nGovernment believes that we can make progress with greater women\u2019s \nparticipation.  \n \n77. In India\u2019s growth story, particularly in the rural economy, \n\u201cgrameen arth vyavastha\u201d the role of women is a very sweet story. This \nGovernment wishes to encourage and facilitate this role of women. \n78. Gender analysis of the budget aimed at examining the budgetary \nallocation through a gender lens has been in place for over a decade. I \npropose to form a broad-based Committee with Government and private \nstakeholders to evaluate and suggest action for moving forward. \n79. There is no segment of human life where the contribution of \nwomen is not significant. This Government firmly believes that the socio-\neconomic transformation that is taking place particularly in the last \ndecade, Indian women\u2019s role and leadership is distinct. The recent \nelections have shown record turnout of women voters at par with men. \nWe also have a record 78 women MPs here. This reinforces our approach \nof going beyond just women-centric-policy making to building women-led \ninitiatives and movements. \n80. This Government has supported and encouraged women \nentrepreneurship through various schemes such as MUDRA, Stand UP \nIndia and the Self Help Group (SHG) movement. In order to further \nencourage women enterprise, I propose to expand the Women SHG \ninterest subvention programme to all districts. Furthermore, for every \nverified women SHG member having a Jan Dhan Bank Account, an \noverdraft of 5,000 shall be allowed. One woman in every SHG will also be \nmade eligible for a loan up to  1 lakh under the MUDRA Scheme. \nIndia\u2019s Soft Power \n81. India\u2019s soft power is appreciated in so many different ways. Some \nsimple examples: In the last three years on International Yoga Day, Yoga \nhas been practiced in large numbers in 192 countries around the world \nYoga has been practiced in large numbers. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s favourite \nbhajan \u201cVaishnav Jana To Tene Kahiye\u201d was sung by the respective lead \nartists in 40 countries. The annual \u201cBharat Ko Jaano\u201d quiz competition is \nsought after as an event to participate by not only NRIs but also several \nforeigners.  \n \n82. I propose to consider issuing Aadhaar Card for Non-Resident \nIndians with Indian Passports after their arrival in India without waiting for \n180 days. \n83. I propose to launch a Mission which will integrate our traditional \nartisans and their creative products with global markets. Wherever \nnecessary we shall obtain patents and geographical indicators for them. \nWith this aim, for the first time in this August House, I declare that we will \nlaunch a mission of linking creative industry with the economy and \nwherever it requires protecting Intellectual Property rights taking it to the \nNational and International Market front. \n84. To give further impetus to India\u2019s growing influence and leadership \nin the international community, Government decided to open Indian \nEmbassies and High Commissions abroad in countries where India does \nnot have a Resident Diplomatic Mission as yet. Accordingly, in March \n2018, Government approved opening of 18 new Indian Diplomatic \nMissions in Africa. Five Embassies have already been opened in Rwanda, \nDjibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Guinea, and Burkina Faso in the \nyear 2018-19. Government intends to open another four new Embassies \nin the year 2019-20. This will not only increase the footprint of India\u2019s \noverseas presence, but also enable us to provide better and more \naccessible public services, especially to the local Indian community in \nthese countries.  \n85. In line with our ancient wisdom, India has always pursued a policy \nof economic cooperation with countries through bilateral and regional \ncoordination.  Indian Development Assistance Scheme (IDEAS) provides \nconcessional financing for projects and contributes to infrastructure \ndevelopment and capacity building in the recipient developing countries.  \nMindful of our position as the sixth largest economy, we will look at \nalternative development models which include private sector equity, \nmultilateral financing, contributions from corporates, non-residents etc. \nI propose to revamp the IDEAS scheme during the current financial year. \n  \n \n86. The Government is developing 17 iconic Tourism Sites into world \nclass tourist destinations and to serve as a model for other tourism sites. \nThe Iconic Tourism Sites would enhance visitor experience which would \nlead to increase visits of both domestic and international tourists at these \ndestinations.  \n87. With the objective of preserving rich tribal cultural heritage, a \ndigital repository is developed where documents, folk songs, photos & \nvideos regarding their evolution, place of origin, lifestyle, architecture, \neducation level, traditional art, folk dances and other anthropological \ndetails of the tribes in India are stored. The repository will further be \nenriched and strengthened.  \nBanking and Financial Sector \n88. Financial gains from cleaning of the banking system are now amply \nvisible. NPAs of commercial banks have reduced by over \n 1 lakh crore \nover the last year, record recovery of over  4 lakh crore due to IBC and \nother measures has been effected over the last four years, provision \ncoverage ratio is now at its highest in seven years, and domestic credit \ngrowth has risen to 13.8%. Government has smoothly carried out \nconsolidation, reducing the number of Public Sector Banks by eight.  At \nthe same time, as many as six Public Sector Banks have been enabled to \ncome out of Prompt Corrective Action framework. \n89. Having addressed legacy issues, Public Sector Banks are now \nproposed to be further provided  70,000 crore capital to boost credit for \na strong impetus to the economy. To further improve ease of living, they \nwill leverage technology, offering online personal loans and doorstep \nbanking, and enabling customers of one Public Sector Bank to access \nservices across all Public Sector Banks. In addition, Government will \ninitiate steps to empower accountholders to remedy the current situation \nin which they do not have control over deposit of cash by others in their \naccounts. Reforms will also be undertaken to strengthen governance in \nPublic Sector Banks.  \n90. Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are playing an \nextremely important role in sustaining consumption demand as well as \ncapital formation in small and medium industrial segment.  NBFCs that are \nfundamentally sound should continue to get funding from banks and \nmutual funds without being unduly risk averse. For purchase of high-rated \npooled assets of financially sound NBFCs, amounting to a total of Rupees \none lakh crore during the current financial year, Government will provide  \n \none time six months' partial credit guarantee to Public Sector Banks for \nfirst loss of up to 10%. Further, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulator \nfor NBFCs.  However, RBI has limited regulatory authority over NBFCs.  \nAppropriate proposals for strengthening the regulatory authority of RBI \nover NBFCs are being placed in the Finance Bill.  \n91. NBFCs which do public placement of debt have to maintain a \nDebenture Redemption Reserve (DRR) and in addition, a special reserve as \nrequired by RBI, has also to be maintained.  To allow NBFCs to raise funds \nin public issues, the requirement of creating a DRR, which is currently \napplicable for only public issues as private placements are exempt, will be \ndone away with. \n92. To bring more participants, especially NBFCs, not registered as \nNBFCs-Factor, on the TReDS platform, amendment in the Factoring \nRegulation Act, 2011 is necessary and steps will be taken to allow all \nNBFCs to directly participate on the TReDS platform.  \n93. Efficient and conducive regulation of the housing sector is \nextremely important in our context.  The National Housing Bank (NHB), \nbesides being the refinancer and lender, is also regulator of the housing \nfinance sector.  This gives a somewhat conflicting and difficult mandate to \nNHB.  I am proposing to return the regulation authority over the housing \nfinance sector from NHB to RBI.  Necessary proposals have been placed in \nthe Finance Bill.   \n94. Government has announced its intention to invest \n 100 lakh crore \nin infrastructure over the next five years. To this end, it is proposed to set \nup an expert committee to study the current situation relating to long-\nterm finance and our past experience with development finance \ninstitutions, and recommend the structure and required flow of funds \nthrough development finance institutions. \n95. Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) \nimplements and regulates the National Pension System (NPS) and Atal \nPension Yojana through various intermediaries including, inter-alia, the \nNPS Trust.  Keeping in view the wider interest of the subscribers and to \nmaintain arm\u2019s length relationship of the NPS Trust with PFRDA, steps will \nbe taken to separate the NPS Trust from PFRDA with appropriate \norganizational structure.   \n96. To facilitate on-shoring of international insurance transactions and \nto enable opening of branches by foreign reinsurers in the International  \n \nFinancial Services Centre, it is proposed to reduce Net Owned Fund \nrequirement from  5,000 crore to  1,000 crore.  \n97. Government has been following the policy of disinvestment in non-\nfinancial public sector undertakings maintaining Government stake not to \ngo below 51%. Government is considering, in case where the Undertaking \nis still to be retained in Government control, to go below 51% to an \nappropriate level on case to case basis. Government has also decided to \nmodify present policy of  retaining 51% Government stake to retaining \n51% stake inclusive of the stake of Government controlled institutions. \n98. In order to improve the capital flows into the Indian economy, it is \nimportant to align domestic corporate systems and practices with global \nones. It is also appreciated that global finance movement in equity uses \ncertain parameters to evaluate the stocks in which they choose to invest. \nGovernment intends to further encourage retail participation in CPSEs \nwhich, of late has shown very encouraging upward trend. In order to \nprovide additional investment space, the Government would realign its \nholding in CPSEs, including Banks to permit greater availability of its \nshares and to improve depth of its market.  \n99. Strategic disinvestment of select CPSEs would continue to remain a \npriority of this Government. In view of current macro-economic \nparameters, Government would not only reinitiate the process of strategic \ndisinvestment of Air India, but would offer more CPSEs for strategic \nparticipation by the private sector. \n100. Government is setting an enhanced target of \n1,05,000 crore of \ndisinvestment receipts for the financial year 2019-20. The Government \nwill undertake strategic sale of PSUs. The Government will also continue \nto do consolidation of PSUs in the non-financial space as well.  \n101. ETFs have proved to be an important investment opportunity for \nretail investors and has turned out to be a good instrument for \nGovernment of India\u2019s divestment programme. To expand this further, \nGovernment will offer an investment option in ETFs on the lines of Equity \nLinked Savings Scheme (ELSS). This would also encourage long term \ninvestment in CPSEs. \n102. For bringing better public ownership of the PSUs and also bring \ngreater commercial and market orientation of the listed PSUs, the \nGovernment will take all necessary steps to meet public shareholding \nnorms of 25% for all listed PSUs and raise the foreign shareholding limits  \n \nto maximum permissible sector limits for all PSU companies which are \npart of Emerging Market Index. \n103. India\u2019s sovereign external debt to GDP is among the lowest globally \nat less than 5%. The Government would start raising a part of its gross \nborrowing programme in external markets in external currencies. This will \nalso have beneficial impact on demand situation for the government \nsecurities in domestic market. \n104. New series of coins of One Rupee, Two Rupees, Five Rupees, Ten \nRupees and Twenty Rupees, easily identifiable to the visually impaired, \nwere released by the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister on 7th March, 2019. These \nnew coins will be made available for public use shortly. \n105. In the first 50 years after Independence we emphasized on \nRights. Marking 75 years of our Independence, we should place emphasis \non our Duty towards India, without undermining Rights. Thinkers, all over \nthe world, have supported the argument that in performing one\u2019s duty \nprotection of one\u2019s rights is inherent. For the bright future of India, when \nagain in 2022, we will remember our freedom fighters, we should \ndedicate ourselves to serve our nation.  \n \n \n \n   \nPART B \n106. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I begin by thanking our taxpayers who, as \nresponsible citizens,  perform their duty by  paying their taxes. It is \nbecause of  their  valuable contribution that our Government  is able to \nwork for our collective dream of inclusive and all round development of \nour nation.  At this juncture, I find wisdom in a line from Pura Nanooru, a \nTamil Sangam Era work by Pisirandaiyaar. The verse ,\u201d Yannai pugundha \nnilam\u201d was sung as an advice to the King Pandian Arivudai Nambi : \n\u201c\u0b95\u0bbe\u1fbc \u0bc6\u0ba8\u1fbf \u0b85\u1fa0\u1fb7\u1f90\u1fb0 \u0b95\u0bb5\u0bb3\u1fb1 \u0bc6\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0bc7\u0ba9,  \n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026     \n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026    \n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026    \n\u0b85\u0bb1\u0bbf\u1fab\u0bc8\u0b9f \u0bc7\u0bb5\u1fb8\u0ba4\u1fb9 \u0bc6\u0ba8\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bb1\u0bbf\u1fb8\u1f90\u0bc6\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0bc7\u0ba9,  \n \n \n \n\u0baa\u0bbe\u0bbf\u1fab\u0ba4\u0baa \u0b8e\u1f8c\u1fb0\u1f81\u1fbb \u0baa\u0bbf\u1fb6\u0b9f\u1fbb \u0ba8\u1fb2\u0b9a\u0bbf\u1fb9, \n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \n\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bc8\u0ba9 \u1f97\u1fb0\u0b95 \u1f97\u0bb2\u1fbb \u0bc7\u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2, \n\u0ba4\u0bbe\u1f94\u1fbb \u0b89\u1fb6\u0ba3\u0bbe\u1fb9,  \u0b89\u0bb2\u0b95\u1f99\u1fbb \u0bc6\u0b95\u1f8c\u0bc7\u0bae.\u201d \nMeaning, a few mounds of rice from paddy that is harvested from a small \npiece of land would suffice for an elephant. But what if the elephant itself \nenters the field and starts eating? What it eats would be far lesser than \nwhat it would trample over ! \n \nDirect Tax   \n107. Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to slew of efforts  taken by our Government, \nthe direct tax revenue  has significantly increased  over the past couple of \nyears. It has increased by over 78% from \n 6.38 lakh crore  in  Financial \nYear 2013-14  to  around  11.37 lakh crore in Financial Year 2018-19. It is \nnow growing at double digit rate every year.   \n108. Let me recall and reiterate this Government\u2019s effort over the past \nfive years to alleviate the tax burden on small and medium income-\nearners. This includes self-employed as well as small traders, salary \nearners, and senior citizens. Only when their annual taxable income \nexceeds \n 5 lakh, they are required to pay any income tax. The details of  \n \nour efforts and achievements on this front during the past few years are \ngiven in the Annexure. \n109. Mr Speaker, Sir, my  tax proposals  will aim to stimulate growth, \nincentivise affordable housing, and encourage start-ups by releasing \nentrepreneurial spirits. It will also be geared towards promoting digital \neconomy.  I aim to simplify tax administration and bring greater \ntransparency.  \n110. So far as corporate tax is concerned, we continue with phased \nreduction in rates. Currently, the lower rate of 25 % is only applicable to \ncompanies having annual turnover up to  250 Crore. I propose to widen \nthis to include all companies having  annual turnover up to  400 crore.  \nThis will  cover 99.3% of the companies. Now only 0.7% of companies will \nremain outside this rate. \nMega Investment in Sunrise and Advanced Technology Areas \n111. In order to boost  economic growth and Make in India, the \ngovernment will launch a scheme to invite global companies through a \ntransparent competitive bidding to set up mega-manufacturing plants  in \nsunrise and advanced technology areas such as Semi-conductor \nFabrication  (FAB),  Solar Photo Voltaic cells, Lithium storage batteries, \nSolar electric charging infrastructure, Computer Servers, Laptops, etc. \nand provide them investment linked income tax exemptions under \nsection 35 AD of the Income Tax Act, and other indirect tax benefits.  \nElectric Vehicles \n112.  Considering our large consumer base, we  aim to leapfrog and \nenvision  India as a global hub of  manufacturing of Electric Vehicles.  \nInclusion of Solar storage batteries and charging infrastructure in the \nabove scheme will boost our efforts. Government has already moved GST \ncouncil to lower the GST rate on electric vehicles from 12% to 5%. Also to \nmake electric vehicle affordable to consumers, our government will \nprovide additional income tax deduction of 1.5 lakh on the interest paid \non loans taken to purchase electric vehicles. This  amounts to a benefit of \naround 2.5 lakh over the  loan period to the taxpayers who  take loans \nto purchase electric vehicle.    \nStart-ups \n113. Start-ups in India are taking firm roots and their continued growth \nneeds to be encouraged.  To resolve the so-called \u2018angel tax\u2019 issue, the \nstart-ups and their investors who file requisite declarations and provide \ninformation in their returns will not be subjected to any kind of scrutiny \nin respect of   valuations of share premiums. The issue of establishing \nidentity of the investor and source of his funds will be resolved   by  \n \nputting in place a mechanism of e-verification.   With this, funds raised by \nstart-ups will not require any kind of scrutiny from the Income Tax \nDepartment.  \n114. In addition, special administrative arrangements shall be made by \nCentral Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for pending assessments of start-\nups and redressal of their grievances. It will be ensured that no inquiry or \nverification in such cases can be carried out by the Assessing Officer \nwithout obtaining approval of his supervisory officer.   \n115. At present, start-ups are not required to justify fair market value \nof their shares issued to certain investors including Category-I Alternative \nInvestment Funds (AIF). I propose to extend this benefit to Category-II \nAlternative Investment Funds also. Therefore, valuation of shares issued \nto these funds shall be beyond the scope of income tax scrutiny. \n116. I also propose to relax some of the conditions for carry forward \nand set off of losses in the case of start-ups. I also propose to extend the \nperiod of exemption of capital gains arising from sale of residential house \nfor investment in start-ups up to 31.3.2021 and relax certain conditions \nof this exemption.    \nAffordable housing \n117.  For realisation of the goal of \u2018Housing for All\u2019 and affordable \nhousing, a tax holiday has already been provided on the profits earned by \ndevelopers of affordable housing. Also, interest paid on housing loans is \nallowed as a deduction to the extent of \n 2 lakh in respect of self-\noccupied property. In order to provide a further impetus, I propose to \nallow an additional deduction of up to  1,50,000/- for interest paid on \nloans borrowed up to 31 st March, 2020 for purchase of an affordable \nhouse valued up to  45 lakh. Therefore, a person purchasing an \naffordable house will now get an enhanced interest deduction up to  3.5 \nlakh. This will translate into a benefit of around  7 lakh to the middle \nclass home-buyers overtheir loan period of 15 years. \nNBFCs \n118. Non-banking financial companies play an increasingly important \nrole in India\u2019s financial system. With the enhanced levels of regulation \nthey are subjected to by the Reserve Bank of India, there is a need to \nprovide greater parity in their tax treatment vis-\u00e0-vis scheduled banks. \nCurrently, interest on certain bad or doubtful debts made by scheduled \nbanks and other financial institutions is allowed to be offered to tax in \nthe year in which this interest is actually received. I propose to extend  \n \nthis facility to deposit taking as well as systemically important non-\ndeposit taking NBFCs also. \nIFSC \n119. To promote the International Financial Services Centre(IFSC) in \nGIFT City, series of measures have already been taken in the past by this \nGovernment.  With a view to further incentivising the IFSC, I propose to \nfurther provide several direct tax incentives to an IFSC including 100 % \nprofit-linked deduction under section 80-LA in any ten-year block within a \nfifteen-year period, exemption from dividend distribution tax  from  \ncurrent and accumulated income to companies and mutual funds, \nexemptions on capital gain to Category-III AIF and interest payment on \nloan taken from non-residents.  \nSecurities Transaction Tax (STT) \n120.  I propose to give relief in levy of Securities Transaction Tax (STT) \nby restricting it only to the difference between settlement and strike \nprice in case of exercise of options. \nSimplification and Ease of living \n121.  India\u2019s Ease of Doing Business ranking under the category of \n\u2018paying taxes\u2019 showed a significant jump from 172 in 2017  to 121 in the \n2019. I now propose to implement series of measures that will leverage \ntechnology to make compliance easier for the taxpayers. \nInterchangeability of PAN and Aadhaar \n122.  Mr Speaker, Sir, more than 120 Crore Indians now have Aadhaar. \nTherefore, for ease and convenience of tax payers, I propose to make \nPAN and Aadhaar interchangeable and allow those who do not have PAN \nto file  Income Tax  returns by simply quoting their Aadhaar number and  \nalso use it wherever they are required to quote PAN.  \nPre-filling of Income-tax Returns \n123. Pre-filled tax returns will be made available to taxpayers which will \ncontain details of salary income, capital gains from securities, bank \ninterests, and dividends etc. and tax deductions. Information regarding \nthese incomes will be collected from the concerned sources such as \nBanks, Stock exchanges, mutual funds, EPFO, State Registration \nDepartments etc. This will not only significantly reduce the time taken to \nfile a tax return, but will also ensure accuracy of reporting of income and \ntaxes.  \n \nFaceless e-assessment \n124. The existing system of scrutiny assessments in the Income-tax \nDepartment involves a high level of personal interaction between the \ntaxpayer and the Department, which leads to certain undesirable \npractices on the part of tax officials.  To eliminate such instances, and to \ngive shape to the vision of the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister, a scheme of \nfaceless assessment in electronic mode  involving no human interface is \nbeing launched this year in a phased manner. To start with, such e-\nassessments shall be carried out in cases requiring verification of certain \nspecified transactions or discrepancies. \n125.   Cases selected for scrutiny shall be allocated to assessment units \nin a random manner and notices shall be issued electronically by a \nCentral Cell, without disclosing the name, designation or location of the \nAssessing Officer. The Central Cell shall be the single point of contact \nbetween the taxpayer and the Department.   This new scheme of \nassessment will represent a paradigm shift in the functioning of the \nIncome Tax Department. \nDigital Payments \n126. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Government has taken a number of \ninitiatives in the recent past for the promotion of digital payments and \nless cash economy. To promote digital payments further, I propose to \ntake a slew of measures. To discourage the practice of making business \npayments in cash, I propose to levy TDS of 2% on cash withdrawal \nexceeding \n 1 crore in a year from a bank account.  Further, there are \nlow-cost digital modes of payment such as BHIM UPI, UPI-QR Code, \nAadhaar Pay, certain Debit cards, NEFT, RTGS etc. which can be used to \npromote less cash economy.  I, therefore, propose that the business \nestablishments with annual turnover more than \n 50 crore shall offer \nsuch low cost digital modes of payment to their customers and no \ncharges or Merchant Discount Rate shall be imposed on customers as \nwell as merchants. RBI and Banks will absorb these costs from the savings \nthat will accrue to them on account of handling less cash as people move  \n \nto these digital modes of payment.  Necessary amendments are being \nmade in the Income Tax Act and the Payments and Settlement Systems \nAct, 2007 to give effect to these provisions. \nRevenue Mobilization \n127.   Mr Speaker Sir, as I have stated earlier,  we have taken several \nmeasures in the past to alleviate the tax burden on small and medium \nincome-earners as those  having annual income up to  \n 5 lakh are not \nrequired to pay any income-tax. We are thankful to the taxpayers who \nplay a major role in  nation building by paying  their taxes. However, in \nview of rising income levels,  those in the highest income brackets, need \nto contribute more to the Nation\u2019s development. I, therefore, propose to \nenhance surcharge on  individuals  having taxable income from   2 crore \nto  5 crore and   5 crore and above  so that effective tax rates for these \ntwo categories will increase by around 3 % and 7 % respectively. \nOther measures \n128. I also propose to simplify the tax law to reduce genuine hardships \nbeing caused to taxpayers which include enhancing threshold of tax for \nlaunching prosecution for non-filing of returns and exempting \nappropriate class of persons from the anti-abuse provisions of section \n50CA and section 56 of the Income Tax Act.   \nIndirect Taxes \n129.  Now coming to Indirect Tax, we are aware that the  landscape has \nchanged significantly with implementation of GST. In every sense, this \nhas been a monumental reform. Centre and States coming together and \nagreeing to pool in their sovereign power of taxation for common good \nof the country was unprecedented. 17 taxes and 13 cesses became one \ntax. Multitude of rates instantly became four. Almost all commodities \nsaw rate reduction. Tens of returns were replaced by one.   Taxpayer\u2019s \ninterface with tax departments got reduced. Border checks got \neliminated. Goods started moving freely across states, which saved time \nand energy. A truck started doing two trips in the same time in which it \nwas doing one. Thus, dream of one nation, one tax, one market was \nrealised. The GST Council deserves all the credit for this.      \n \n130. In the initial phase GST witnessed certain teething problems. This \nwas natural considering the scale of the reform. However, the Council, \nCentre and States proactively worked to resolve these issues.   GST rates \nhave also been reduced significantly, where relief of about 92,000 crore \nper year has been given.  We should not lose sight of this fact while \njudging the performance of GST. The details are given in the annexure.  \n131.  We are further simplifying the GST processes. A simplified single \nmonthly return is being rolled out. Taxpayer having annual turnover of \nless than   5 crore shall file quarterly return. Free accounting software \nfor return preparation has been made available to small businesses.  A \nfully automated GST refund module shall be implemented.  Multiple tax \nledgers for a taxpayer shall be replaced by one. \n132. It is also proposed to move to an electronic invoice system \nwherein invoice details will be captured in a central system at the time of \nissuance. This will eventually be used to prefill the taxpayer\u2019s returns. \nThere will be no need for a separate e-way bill. Its roll out would begin \nfrom January, 2020.    Electronic invoice system will significantly reduce \nthe compliance burden.   \n133.  On the Customs side my proposals are driven with the objectives \nof securing our borders, achieving higher domestic value addition \nthrough make in India, reducing import dependence, protection to MSME \nsector, promoting clean energy, curbing non-essential imports, and \ncorrecting inversions.  \n134.  Defence has an immediate requirement of modernisation and \nupgradation. This is a national priority. For this purpose, import of \ndefence equipment that are not being manufactured in India are being \nexempted from the basic customs duty.    \n135. Make in India is a cherished goal.  In order to provide  domestic \nindustry a level playing field, basic customs duty is being increased on \nitems such as cashew kernels, PVC, Vinyl flooring, tiles, metal fittings, \nmountings for furniture, auto parts, certain kinds of synthetic rubbers, \nmarble slabs, optical fibre cable, CCTV camera, IP camera, digital and \nnetwork video recorders etc. Also, exemptions from custom duty on \ncertain electronic items which are now being manufactured in India are  \n \nbeing withdrawn. Further, end use based exemptions on palm stearin, \nfatty oils, and exemptions to various kinds of papers are also being \nwithdrawn. To encourage domestic publishing and printing industry, 5 % \ncustom duty is being imposed on imported books.  \n136.  To further promote domestic manufacturing, customs duty \nreductions are being proposed on certain raw materials and capital \ngoods. These include certain inputs of CRGO sheets, amorphous alloy \nribbon, ethylene di-chloride, propylene oxide, cobalt matte, naphtha, \nwool fibres, inputs for manufacture of artificial kidney and disposable \nsterilised dialyser, and fuels for nuclear power plants. To further \nincentivise e-mobility, customs duty is being exempted on certain parts \nof electric vehicles. Customs duty is also being exempted on capital goods \nrequired for manufacture of specified electronic goods. \n137.  Export duty is being rationalised on raw and semi-finished leather \nto provide relief to this sector. \n138.   Crude prices have softened from their highs. This gives me a room \nto review excise duty and cess on petrol and diesel. I propose to increase \nSpecial Additional Excise duty and Road and Infrastructure Cess each by \none rupee a litre on petrol and diesel. It is also proposed to increase \ncustom duty on gold and other precious metals from 10% to 12.5%.  \n139.  Tobacco products and crude attract National Calamity and \nContingent duty. In certain cases this levy has been contested on the \nground that there is no basic excise duty on these items. To address this \nissue, a nominal basic excise duty is being imposed. \n140.  I am also proposing few amendments to the Customs Act. Recent \ntrends reveal that certain bogus entities are resorting to unfair practices \nto avail undue concessions and export incentives.   While we have \nintensified our efforts against such nefarious activities, provisions are \nbeing incorporated in the Act for enhanced penalty and prosecution for \nsuch offences. Further, misuse of duty free scrips and drawback facility \ninvolving more than fifty lakh rupees will be a cognizable and non-\nbailable offence.  \n \n141.   GST has just completed two years. An area that concerns me is \nthat we have huge pending litigations from pre-GST regime. More than  \n3.75 lakh crore is blocked in litigations in service tax and excise. There is a \nneed to unload this baggage and allow business to move on. I, therefore, \npropose, a Legacy Dispute Resolution Scheme that will allow quick \nclosure of these litigations. I would urge the trade and business to avail \nthis opportunity and be free from legacy litigations.  \n142.  The details of my tax proposals  are given in the Annexure. \n143. Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words I commend the Budget to this \naugust House. \n   \n \nAnnex to Part B of Budget Speech \nDirect Tax Proposals: \n1. Widening and deepening of tax base  \n1.1 Deduction of tax by certain individuals or HUF : Presently, there is \nno requirement for an individual or HUF to deduct tax at source \non payments made to a resident contractor or professional when \nit is for personal use, or if the individual or HUF is not subjected to \naudit for his business or profession. It is proposed to insert a new \nprovision making it obligatory for such individual or HUF to deduct \ntax at source at the rate of five per cent. if the annual payment \nmade to a contractor or professional exceeds Rs. 50 lakh. It is also \nproposed that a person deducting tax under this section shall be \nable to deposit TDS on the basis of the Permanent Account \nNumber (PAN) only. It is also proposed to enable filing of \napplication for issue of certificate for nil or lower rate of TDS. \n1.2 Consideration for TDS on immovable property\n: It is proposed to \nprovide that for the purpose of tax deduction at source from \npayment made for acquisition of immovable property, \nconsideration shall include other charges in the nature of club \nmembership fee, car parking fee, electricity and water facility fee, \nmaintenance fee, advance fee or any other charges of similar \nnature which are incidental to the purchase of immovable \nproperty. \n1.3 Gifts made to non-residents\n: Presently, gifts made by a resident to \nanother resident are liable for income tax subject to some \nexemptions. It is proposed to provide that gift of any sum of \nmoney, or property situated in India, by a person resident in India \nto a person outside India (not being a gift otherwise exempt), on or \nafter 5th day of July 2019, shall be deemed to accrue or arise in \nIndia.  \n1.4 Compulsory filing of return:\n It is proposed to make return filing \ncompulsory for persons, who have deposited more than Rs. 1 crore \nin a current account in a year, or who have expended more than Rs. \n2 lakh on foreign travel or more than Rs. 1 lakh on electricity \nconsumption in a year or who fulfils the prescribed conditions, in \norder to ensure that persons who enter into high value transactions \nalso furnish return of income. It is also proposed to provide that a  \n \nperson whose income becomes lower than maximum amount not \nchargeable to tax due to claim of rollover benefit of capital gains \nshall also be required to furnish the return. \n1.5 Interchangeability of PAN and Aadhaar : It is proposed to provide \ninterchangeability of PAN and Aadhaar to enable a person who \ndoes not have PAN but has Aadhaar to use Aadhaar in place of PAN \nunder the Act. The Income Tax Department shall allot PAN to such \nperson on the basis of Aadhaar after obtaining demographic data \nfrom the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). It is also \nproposed to provide that a person who has already linked his \nAadhaar with his PAN may at his option use Aadhaar in place of \nPAN under the Act.  \n1.6 Quoting of PAN/Aadhaar\n: In order to track high value transactions, \nit is proposed to provide that the quoting and authentication of \nPAN/Aadhaar shall be mandatory for certain prescribed \ntransactions.

To \nensure compliance of these provisions it is also proposed to amend \nthe relevant penalty provisions. \n1.7 Consequences of not linking Aadhaar with PAN\n: Presently, the Act \nprovides for making PAN invalid if it is not linked with Aadhaar \nwithin a notified date. In order to protect past transactions carried \nout through such PAN, it is proposed to provide that if a person \nfails to intimate the Aadhaar number, the PAN allotted to such \nperson shall be made inoperative in the prescribed manner after \nthe date notified for the said linking. \n1.8 Widening the scope of SFT\n: In order to obtain more information to \nenable pre-filling of returns of income, it is proposed to widen the \nscope of furnishing of statement of financial transactions (SFT) by \nmandating furnishing of statement by the prescribed persons other \nthan those who are currently furnishing the same. It is also \nproposed to remove the current threshold of Rs. 50,000 for \napplication of the provisions requiring furnishing of information, in \norder to ensure pre-filling of smaller amounts of transactions also. \nFurther, for ensuring the accuracy of the information furnished, a \nsuitable amendment to the relevant penalty provisions is also \nproposed.  \n \n2. Measures for promoting less cash economy \n2.1 Payment by other electronic modes : There are various provisions in \nthe Act which prohibit cash transactions and allow or encourage \npayment or receipt only through account payee cheque, account \npayee draft or electronic clearing system through a bank account. \nTo promote other electronic modes of payment, it is proposed to \namend these provisions to also allow payment or receipt through \nother prescribed electronic modes. \n2.2 TDS on cash withdrawal from banks : In order to discourage large \namount of cash withdrawal from bank accounts, it is proposed to \nprovide for tax deduction at source at the rate of 2% on cash \nwithdrawal by a person in excess of Rs. 1 crore in a year from his \nbank account. Some business models, where large cash withdrawal \nis a necessity, are proposed to be exempted. It is also proposed that \nthe Central Government may notify the persons to whom these \nprovisions shall not be applicable in consultation with the Reserve \nBank of India. \n2.3 Facilities for low-cost electronic payments\n: For ensuring that \nbusiness enterprises provide facility for making payment through \nlow-cost electronic mode, it is proposed to insert a new section so \nas to provide that a business enterprise whose annual turnover \nexceeds Rs. 50 crore shall provide facility for prescribed low cost \nelectronic modes of payment. For ensuring compliance, a suitable \npenalty provision is also proposed to be inserted in the Act.  \n3. Tax Incentives\n \n3.1 International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) :In order to promote \nthe development of world class financial infrastructure in India, \nsome tax concessions have already been provided in respect of \nbusinesses carried on from an IFSC.

However, in cases of scheduled \nbanks, public financial institutions, state financial corporations, \nstate industrial investment corporations, cooperative banks and  \n \ncertain public companies like housing finance companies, interest \non bad or doubtful debts is charged to tax on receipt basis. To \nprovide a level playing field, it is proposed that interest on bad or \ndoubtful debts in the case of deposit-taking NBFC and systemically \nimportant non deposit-taking NBFC shall be charged to tax on \nreceipt basis. It is also proposed to provide that deduction of such \ninterest shall be allowed to the payer on actual payment.    \n3.3 Incentives for start-ups\n: The condition for carry forward and set off \nof losses in cases of eligible start-ups is proposed to be relaxed \nenabling them to carry forward their losses on satisfaction of any \none of the two conditions, i.e. continuity of 51% \nshareholding/voting power or continuity of 100% of original \nshareholders.

It is \nproposed  to incorporate this tax incentive in the Income-tax Act. \n3.7 Incentives to encourage offshore funds:\n In 2015, the Government \nhad enacted a specific concessional regime to facilitate location of \nfund managers of offshore funds in India. This was subjected to \nsome conditions.
