A new world order is emerging after \nthe Covid pandemic.  \n30. India assumed G20  Presidency during very difficult times \nfor the world. The global economy was going through high \ninflation, high interest rates, low growth, very high public debt, \n9 \n low trade growth, and climate challenges. The pandemic had led \nto a crisis of food, fertilizer, fuel and finances for the world, while \nIndia successfully navigated its way. The country showed the way \nforward and built consensus on solutions for those global \nproblems.  \n31. The rec ently announced India -Middle East -Europe \nEconomic Corridor is a strategic and economic game changer for \nIndia and others.

After the successful adoption of Nano Urea, application of \nNano DAP on various crops will be expanded in all agro -climatic \nzones.   \nAtmanirbhar Oil Seeds Abhiyan \n53. Building on the initiative announced in 2022, a strategy \nwill be formulated to achieve \u2018atmanirbharta\u2019  for oil seeds such \nas mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower. This \nwill cover research for high -yielding variet ies, widespread \nadoption of modern farming techniques, market linkages, \nprocurement, value addition, and crop insurance.      \nDairy Development \n54. A comprehensive programme forsupporting dairy farmers \nwill be formulated. Efforts are already on to control foot and \nmouth disease. India is the world\u2019s largest milk producer but \nwith low productivity of milch -animals. The programme will be \nbuilt on the success of existing schemes such RashtriyaGokul \nMission, National Livestock Mission, and Infrastructure \nDevelopment Funds for dairy processing and animal husbandry.   \nMatsyaSampada \n15 \n 55. It was our G overnment which set up a separate \nDepartment for Fisheries realizing the importance of assisti ng \nfishermen. This has resulted in doubling of both inland and \naquaculture production. Seafood export since 2013 -14 has also \ndoubled.  Implementation of Pradhan \nMantriMatsyaSampadaYojana (PMMSY) will be stepped up to:  \n(1) enhance aquaculture productivity from  existing 3 to  \n5 tons per hectare,  \n(2) double exports to ` 1 lakh crore and  \n(3) generate 55 lakh employment opportunities in near \nfuture.  \nFive integrated aquaparks will be setup.  \nLakhpatiDidi \n56. Eighty-three lakh SHGs  with nine crore women are \ntransforming rural socio -economic landscape with \nempowerment and self -reliance. Their success has assisted \nnearly one crore women to become LakhpatiDidi already. They \nare an inspiration to others. Their achievements will be \nrecognized through honouring them. Buoyed by the success, it \nhas been decided to enhance the target for LakhpatiDidi from  \n2 crore to 3 crore.  \nTechnological Changes \n57. New age technologies  and dataare changing the lives of \npeople and businesses. The y are also enabling new economic \n16 \n opportunities and facilitating provision of high-quality services at \naffordable prices for all, including those at \u2018bottom of the \npyramid\u2019. Opportunities for India at the global level are \nexpanding. India is showing solutions through innovation and \nentrepreneurship of its people.  \nResearch and Innovation for catalyzing growth, employment \nand development \n58. Prime Minister Shastri gave the slogan of \u201cJai Jawan Jai \nKisan\u201d. Prime Minister Vajpayee made that \u201cJai Jawan Jai Kisan \nJai Vigyan\u201d. P rime Minister Modi has furthered that to \u201cJai \nJawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan and Jai Anusandhan\u201d , as innovation is \nthe foundation of development.  \n59. For our tech savvy youth, this will be a golden era.  \nA corpus of rupees one lakh crore will be established with  \nfifty-year interest free loan . The corpus will provide long -term \nfinancing or refinancing with long tenors and low or nil interest \nrates. This will encourage the private sectorto scale up research \nand innovation significantly in sunrise domains. We need to have \nprogrammes that combine the powers of our youth and \ntechnology. \n60. A new scheme will be launched for strengthening  \ndeep-tech technologies for defence purposes and expediting \n\u2018atmanirbharta\u2019.    \nInfrastructure Development \n17 \n 61. Building on the massive tripling of the capital expenditure \noutlay in the past 4 years resulting in huge multiplier impact on \neconomic growth and employment creation, the outlay for the \nnext year is being increased by 11.1 per cent to eleven lakh, \neleven thousand, one hundred and eleven crore rupees  \n(` 11,11,111 crore). This would be 3.4 per cent of the GDP.  \nRailways \n62. Three major economic railway corridor programmes will \nbe implemented. These are: \n(1) energy, mineral and cement corridors,  \n(2) port connectivity corridors, and  \n(3) high traffic density corridors.  \nThe projects have been identified under the PM Gati Shakti for \nenabling multi-modal connectivity. They will improve logistics \nefficiency and reduce cost.  \n63.   The resultant decongestion of the high- traffic corridors \nwill also help in improving operations of passenger trains, \nresulting in safety and higher travel speed for passengers. \nTogether with dedicated freight corridors, these three economic \ncorridor programmes will accelerate our GDP growth and reduce \nlogistic costs.   \n64. Forty thousand normal rail bogies will be converted to the \nVande Bharat standards to enhance safety , convenience and \ncomfort of passengers. \n18 \n Aviation Sector \n65. The aviation sector has been galvanized in the past  \nten years. Num ber of airports have doubled to 149. Roll out of \nair connectivity to tier- two and tier -three cities under UDAN \nscheme has been widespread.  Five hundred and seventeen new \nroutes are carrying 1.3 crore passengers. Indian carriers have  \npro-actively placed orders for over 1000 new aircrafts. Expansion \nof existing airports and development of new airports will \ncontinue expeditiously. \nMetro and NaMo Bharat  \n66. We have a fast -expanding middle class and rapid \nurbanization is taking place.  Metro Rail and NaMo Bharat can be \nthe catalyst for the required urban transformation. Expansion of \nthese systems will be supported in large cities focusing on \ntransit-oriented development. \nGreen Energy  \n67. Towards meeting our commitment for \u2018net -zero\u2019 by 2070, \nthe following measures will be taken. \na. Viability gap funding will be provided for harnessing \noffshore wind energy potential for initial capacity of \none giga-watt. \nb. Coal gasification and liquefaction capacity of 100 MT \nwill be set up by 2030. This will also help in reducing \nimports of natural gas, methanol, and ammonia.   \n19 \n c. Phased mandatory blending of compressed biogas  \n(CBG) in compressed natural gas (CNG) for transport \nand piped natural gas (PNG) for domestic purposes will \nbe mandated.  \nd. Financial assistance will be provided for procurement \nof biomass aggregation machinery to support \ncollection. \nElectric Vehicle Ecosystem \n68. Our Government will expand and strengthen the e -vehicle \necosystemby supporting manufacturing and charging \ninfrastructure. Greater adoption of e -buses for public transport \nnetworks will be encouraged through payment security \nmechanism.  \nBio-manufacturing and Bio-foundry \n69. For promotin g green growth, a new scheme of  \nbio-manufacturing and bio -foundry will be launched. This will \nprovide environment friendly alternatives such as biodegradable \npolymers, bio -plastics, bio -pharmaceuticals and bio -agri-inputs.  \nThis scheme will also help in transforming today\u2019s consumptive \nmanufacturing paradigm to the one based on regenerative \nprinciples. \nBlue Economy 2.0 \n70. For promoting climate resilient activities for blue economy \n2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and \n20 \n coastal aquaculture and mariculturewith integrated and  \nmulti-sectoral approach will be launched. \n \n \nComprehensive development of tourist centres \n71. The success of organizing G20 meetings in sixty places \npresented diversity of India to global audience. Our economic \nstrength has made the country an attractive destin ation for \nbusiness and conference tourism. Our middle class also now \naspires to travel and explore. Tourism, including spiritual \ntourism, has tremendous opportunities for local \nentrepreneurship. \n72. States will be encouraged to take up comprehensive \ndevelopment of iconic tourist centres, branding and marketing \nthem at global scale. A framework for rating of the centres based \non quality of facilities and services will be established. Long -term \ninterest free loans will be provided to States for financing such \ndevelopment on matching basis. \n73. To address the emerging fervour for domestic tourism, \nprojects for port connectivity, tourism infrastructure, and \namenities will be taken up on our islands, including \nLakshadweep. This will help in generating employment also. \nPromoting Investments \n21 \n 74. The FDI inflow during 2014-23 was USD 596 billion marking \na golden era . Th at is tw ice the inflow during 2005 -14.   \nFor encouraging sustained foreign investment, we are \nnegotiating bilateral investment treaties with our foreign \npartners, in the spirit of \u2018first develop India\u2019.  \n \nReforms in the States for \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 \n75. Many growth and development enabling reforms are \nneeded in the states for realizing the vision of \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019.  \nA provision of seventy-fivethousand crore rupees as fifty -year \ninterest free loan is proposed this year to support those \nmilestone-linked reforms by the State Governments. \nSocietal Changes \n76. The Government will form a high- powered committee for \nan extensive consideration of the challenges arising from fast \npopulation growth and demographic changes.The committee will \nbe mandated to make recommendations for addressing these \nchallenges comprehensively in relation to the goal of \u2018Viksit \nBharat\u2019. \nAmritKaal as KartavyaKaal \n77. Our Government stands committed to strengthening and \nexpanding the economy with high growth and t o create \nconditions for people to realize their aspirations.  Hon\u2019ble Prime \nMinister in his Independence Day address to the nation, in the \n22 \n 75th year of our Republic said; we \u201ccommit ourselves to national \ndevelopment, with new inspirations, new consciousnes s, new \nresolutions, as the country opens up immense possibilities and \nopportunities\u201d. It is our \u2018KartavyaKaal\u2019. \n78. Every challenge of the pre-2014 era was overcome \nthrough our economic management and our governance. These \nhave placed the country on a resolute path of sustained high \ngrowth.  This has been possible through our right policies, true \nintentions, and appropriate decisions. In the full budget in July, \nour Government will present a detailed roadmap for our pursuit \nof \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019.  \nRevised Estimates 2023-24 \n79. The Revised Estimate of the total receipts other than \nborrowings is ` 27.56 lakh crore, of which the tax receipts are  \n`23.24 lakh crore. The Revised Estimate of the total expenditure \nis `44.90 lakh crore.      \n80. The revenue receipts at ` 30.03 lakh crore are expected to \nbe higher than the Budget Estimate, reflecting strong growth \nmomentum and formalization in the economy.  \n81. The Revised Estimate of the fiscal deficit is 5.8 per cent of \nGDP, improving on the Budget Estimate, notwithstanding \nmoderation in the nominal growth estimates.        \nBudget Estimates 2024-25 \n23 \n 82. Coming to 2024- 25, the total receipts other than \nborrowings and the total expenditure are estimated at ` 30.80 \nand 47.66 lakh crore respectively. The tax receipts are estimated \nat ` 26.02 lakh crore.     \n83. The scheme of fifty -year interest free loan for capital \nexpenditure to states will be continued this year with total outlay \nof `1.3 lakh crore. \n84. We continue on the path of fiscal consolidation, as \nannounced in my Budget Speech for 2021 -22, to reduce fiscal \ndeficit below 4.5 per cent by 2025 -26. The fiscal deficit in  \n2024-25 is estimated to be 5.1  per cent of GDP, adhering to that \npath.  \n85.  The gross and net market borrowings through dated \nsecurities during 2024- 25 are estimated at `14.13 and  \n11.75 lakh crore respectively. Both will be less than that in  \n2023-24. Now that the private investments are happening at \nscale, the lower borrowings by the Central Government will \nfacilitate larger availability of credit for the private sector.   \nVote on Account \n86. I will be seeking \u2018vote on account\u2019 approval of the \nParliament through the Appropriation Bill for a part of the \nfinancial year 2024-25.    \nI will, now, move to Part B. \n24 \n   \n25 \n Part B \nHon\u2019ble Speaker Sir, \nDirect taxes \n87. Over the last ten years, the direct tax collections have \nmore than trebled and the return filers swelled to 2.4 times.  \nI would like to assure the taxpayers that their contributions have \nbeen used wisely for the development of the country and \nwelfare of it s people. I appreciate the tax payers for their \nsupport. \n88. The Government has reduced and rationalized tax rates. \nUnder the new tax scheme, there is now no tax liability for tax \npayers with income up to \u20b9 7 lakh, up from \u20b9 2.2 lakh in the \nfinancial year 2013 -14. The threshold for presumptive taxation \nfor retail businesses was increased from \u20b9 2 crore to \u20b9 3 crore. \nSimilarly, the threshold for professionals eligible for presumptive \ntaxation was increased from \u20b9 50 lakh to \u20b9 75 Lakh. Also, \ncorporate tax rate was decreased from 30 per cent to 22 per cent \nfor existing domestic companies and to 15 per cent for certain \nnew manufacturing companies. \n89. In the last five years, our focus has been to improve  \ntax-payer services. The age -old jurisdiction -based assessment \nsystem was transformed with the introduction of Faceless \nAssessment and Appeal, thereby imparting greater efficiency, \ntransparency and accountability. Introduction of updated income \ntax returns, a new Form 26AS and prefilling of tax returns have \n26 \n made filing of tax returns simpler and easier. Average processing \ntime of returns has been reduced from 93 days in the year  \n2013-14 to a mere ten days this year, thereby making refunds \nfaster.  \nIndirect Taxes \n90. By unifying the highly fragmented indirect tax regime in \nIndia, GST has reduced the compliance burden on trade and \nindustry. The industry has acknowledged the benefits of GST. \nAccording to a recent survey conducted by a leading consulting \nfirm, 94 per cent of industry leaders view the transition to GST as \nlargely positive. According to 80  per cent of the respondents, it \nhas led to supply chain optimisation, as elimination of tax \narbitrage and octroi has resulted in disbanding of check posts at \nstate a nd city boundaries. At the same time, tax base of GST \nmore than doubled and the average monthly gross GST \ncollection has almost doubled to \u20b9 1.66 lakh crore, this year. \nStates too have benefited. States\u2019 SGST revenue, including \ncompensation released to states, in the post-GST period of  \n2017-18 to 2022-23,has achieved a buoyancy of 1.22. In contrast, \nthe tax buoyancy of State revenues from subsumed taxes in the \npre-GST four -year period of 2012- 13 to 2015- 16 was a mere \n0.72. The biggest beneficiaries are the consumers, as reduction \nin logistics costs and taxes have brought down prices of most \ngoods and services. \n27 \n 91. We have taken a number of steps in Customs to facilitate \ninternational trade. As a result, the import release time declined \nby 47 per cent to 71 hours at Inland Container Depots, by 28  per \ncent to 44 hours at air cargo complexes and by 27  per cent  to  \n85 hours at sea ports, over the last four years since 2019, when \nthe National Time Release Studies were first started. \nTax proposals \n92. As for tax proposals, in keeping with the convention, I do \nnot propose to make any changes relating to taxation and \npropose to retain the same tax rates for direct taxes and indirect \ntaxes including import duties. However, certain tax benefits to \nstart-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth or pension \nfunds as also tax exemption on certain income of some IFSC units \nare expiring on 31.03.2024. To provide continuity in taxation,  \nI propose to extend the date to 31.03.2025. \n93. Moreover, in line with ourGovernment\u2019s vision to improve \nease of living and ease of doing business, I wish to make an \nannouncement to improve tax payer services. There are a large \nnumber of petty, non- verified, non-reconciled or disputed direct \ntax demands, many of them dating as fa r back as the year 1962, \nwhich continue to remain on the books, causing anxiety to \nhonest tax payers and hindering refunds of subsequent years.  \nI propose to withdraw such outstanding direct tax demands up \nto twenty -five thousand rupees (\u20b9 25,000) pertaining to the \nperiod up to financial year 2009 -10 and up to ten -thousand \n28 \n rupees (\u20b9 10,000) for financial years 2010 -11 to 2014- 15. This is \nexpected to benefit about a crore tax-payers. \nEconomy \u2013 Then and Now \n94. In 2014 when our G overnment assumed the reins, the \nresponsibility to mend the economy step by step and to put the \ngovernance systems in order was enormous. The need of the \nhour was to give hope to the people, to attract investments, and \nto build support for the much- needed reforms. The Government \ndid that successfully following our strong belief of \u2018nation-first\u2019.  \n95. The crisis of those years has been overcome, and the \neconomy has been put firmly on a high sustainable growth path \nwith all -round development. It is now appropriate to look at \nwhere we were then till 2014 and where we are now, only for \nthe purpose of drawing lessons from the mismanagement of \nthose years. The Government will lay a White Paper on table of \nthe House.  \n96. The exemplary track record of governance, development \nand performance , effective del ivery, and \u2018Jan Kalyan\u2019 has given \nthe Government trust, confidence and blessings of the people to \nrealize, whatever it takes, the goal of \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 with good \nintentions, true dedication and hard work in the coming years \nand decades.  \n97. With this, I commend the interim budget to this august \nHouse. \nJai Hind. \n29 \n ",
