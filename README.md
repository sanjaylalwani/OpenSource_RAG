# OpenSource_RAG

I have created this repository to create RAG with the help of all the Open Source Solutions.

I am building chatbot on budget presented by India Finance Minister Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman.

**Data**: Budget Speech in pdf format

## Technologies used

## Advanced RAG techniques used as follow,
1. **Chunk Overlapping**: Chunk overlapping is a technique where a small portion of text from one chunk is included in the next. This helps to maintain contextual continuity between chunks.
  Example:
  
  Original Text:
  "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI systems. They are trained on massive datasets to understand and generate human-like text."
  
  Chunking with Overlap (Chunk Size = 20 characters, Overlap = 10 characters)
  
  Chunk 1: "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI systems."  
  Chunk 2: "are powerful AI systems. They are trained on massive datasets"  
  Chunk 3: "on massive datasets to understand and generate human-like text."
